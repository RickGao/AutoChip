// Implement in Verilog the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as input the output of a two-input XOR. The flip-flop is positive edge triggered by clk, but there is no reset. The XOR takes as input 'in' along with the output 'out' of the flip-flop.

module top_module (
	input clk,
	input in,
	output logic out
);
