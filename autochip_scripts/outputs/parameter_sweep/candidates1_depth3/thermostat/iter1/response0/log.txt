{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A heating/cooling thermostat controls both a heater (during winter) and an air conditioner (during summer). Implement a circuit that will turn on and off the heater, air conditioning, and blower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the heater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air conditioner. In cooling mode, turn the air conditioner on when it is too hot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn on the heater. When the heater or air conditioner are on, also turn on the fan to circulate the air. In addition, the user can also request the fan to turn on (fan_on = 1), even if the heater and air conditioner are off.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput mode,\n\tinput too_cold, \n\tinput too_hot,\n\tinput fan_on,\n\toutput heater,\n\toutput aircon,\n\toutput fan\n);'}
