system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // A heating/cooling thermostat controls both a heater (during winter) and an air conditioner (during summer). Implement a circuit that will turn on and off the heater, air conditioning, and blower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the heater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air conditioner. In cooling mode, turn the air conditioner on when it is too hot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn on the heater. When the heater or air conditioner are on, also turn on the fan to circulate the air. In addition, the user can also request the fan to turn on (fan_on = 1), even if the heater and air conditioner are off.
