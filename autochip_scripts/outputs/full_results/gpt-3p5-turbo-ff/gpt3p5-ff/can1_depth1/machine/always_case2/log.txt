system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // 	In this module, "in" is the input and "pos" is the output.
	"pos" will be set to different values depending on the value of "in".
	The case statement uses the value of "in" to set the value of "pos".
	If "in" is 0, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 1, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 2, "pos" will be set to 1.
	If "in" is 3, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 4, "pos" will be set to 2.
	If "in" is 5, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 6, "pos" will be set to 1.
	If "in" is 7, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 8, "pos" will be set to 3.
	If "in" is 9, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 10, "pos" will be set to 1.
	If "in" is 11, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 12, "pos" will be set to 2.
	If "in" is 13, "pos" will be set to 0.
	If "in" is 14, "pos" will be set to 1.
	If "in" is 15, "pos" will be set to 0.
	In all other cases "pos" will be set to 0.
	The value of "pos" is set every clock cycle.
