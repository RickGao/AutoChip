system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is used to detect any edge on the input signal. The module has three ports: clk, in, and anyedge. The clk port is an input signal that is used to control the timing of the module. The in port is an 8-bit input signal that is used as the signal to detect edges on. The anyedge port is an 8-bit output signal that is used to indicate if an edge was detected on the in signal.  The module contains a register d_last that is used to store the previous value of the in signal. The always block is used to detect any edge on the in signal. Inside the always block, the d_last register is updated with the current value of the in signal. The anyedge output signal is then calculated by performing an exclusive-or (XOR) operation between the current value of the in signal and the value stored in the d_last register. If the values are different, then an edge was detected and the anyedge output signal will be set to 1. If the values are the same, then no edge was detected and the anyedge output signal will be set to 0.
