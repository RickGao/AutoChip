system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // 
The signal clk is the clock signal and should be a signal that is asserted high for a very short time
and is then deasserted low. This signal is input to the module.
The signal reset is the signal that resets the state of the module and is input to the module.
The signal in is the input to the module and is a 32 bit signal.
The signal out is the output of the module and is a 32 bit signal.
The signal d_last is used to store the previous value of in.

When the clock signal is asserted the input value is stored in the d_last signal and the output value is
modified such that the value of out is assigned the value of out ORed with the NOT of the input
signal ANDed with the previous value of the input.

The output value of out is 0 initially when the reset is asserted.
