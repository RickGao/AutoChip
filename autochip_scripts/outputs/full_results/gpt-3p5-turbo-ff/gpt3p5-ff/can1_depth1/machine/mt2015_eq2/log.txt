system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple comparison module. It takes two 2-bit inputs, A and B, and compares them bit-by-bit. If all the bits of A are equal to the corresponding bits of B, then the output z is set to 1. Otherwise, z is set to 0. The module does not have any internal logic or state transitions, as it is simply a comparison of two inputs. The port connections of the module are as follows: A and B are both 2-bit inputs, and z is a single-bit output.

module top_module(
	input [1:0] A,
	input [1:0] B,
	output z);
assistant: module top_module(
	input [1:0] A,
	input [1:0] B,
	output z);

	assign z = (A[0] == B[0]) && (A[1] == B[1]);
	
endmodule
