system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // FSM machine is implemented on this code.
From A state it goes to B and from B state it goes to S0.
From S0, if x is 1 then it goes to S1 and if x is 0 then it stays in S0 itself.
From S1, if x is 1 then it stays in S1 and if x is 0 then it goes to S10.
From S10, if x is 1 then it goes to G1 and if x is 0 then it goes to S0.
From G1, if y is 1 then it goes to P1 and if y is 0 then it goes to G2.
From G2, if y is 1 then it goes to P1 and if y is 0 then it goes to P0.
From P0, it stays in P0.
From P1, it stays in P1.

f is assigned to 1 when the state is B.
g is assigned to 1 when the state is G1 or G2 or P1.
