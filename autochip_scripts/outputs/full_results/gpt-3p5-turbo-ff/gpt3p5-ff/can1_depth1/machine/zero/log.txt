system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a simple module that assigns the output zero to a value of 0. This module does not have any inputs and is used to assign a constant value to the output. This module is useful when a constant value is needed for a design. For example, if a design requires a signal to be always 0, this module can be used to assign the output zero to 0. This module can also be used to assign a constant value to a signal that is used as an input to another module.

	output zero);
assistant: module top_module(
	output reg zero);

		zero = 0;
