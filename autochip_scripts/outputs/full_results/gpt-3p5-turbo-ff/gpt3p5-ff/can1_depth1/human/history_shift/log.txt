system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Build a 32-bit global history shift register, including support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush caused by a branch misprediction. When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the direction of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs (train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the history after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence, because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the history counter to zero.
