system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a 4-bit register. The module has 6 inputs and 1 output. The inputs are a clock (clk), an asynchronous reset (areset), a load signal (load), an enable signal (ena), and a 4-bit data input (data). The output is a 4-bit register (q).  The module is always sensitive to the rising edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. When the asynchronous reset is active, the output register is set to 0. When the load signal is active, the data input is loaded into the output register. When the enable signal is active, the output register is shifted left by 1 bit. When none of the signals are active, the output register remains unchanged.
