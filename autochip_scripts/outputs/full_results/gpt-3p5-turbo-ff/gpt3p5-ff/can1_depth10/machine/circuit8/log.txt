system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module has 2 inputs and 2 outputs. The inputs are a clock (clock) and a signal (a). The outputs are two registers, p and q. The clock signal is used to trigger the two always blocks. The first always block is triggered on the negative edge of the clock signal. This always block assigns the current value of the signal a to the register q. The second always block is triggered on any change of the input signal a. This always block assigns the current value of the signal a to the register p if the clock signal is high.
