system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Build a circuit that always outputs a LOW.

assistant: module top_module(
	output reg zero); // Adding 'reg' keyword to declare 'zero' as a register
	 
	always @(*) // Use '@(*)' for combinational logic (no inputs)
	begin
		zero = 0; // Assign 'zero' to 0 for a LOW output
	end
	
endmodule


user: The design compiled with warnings. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
/home/jmb9986/AutoChip/autochip_scripts/outputs/gpt3p5-ff/can1_depth10/human/zero/iter0/response0/top_module.sv:4: warning: @* found no sensitivities so it will never trigger.
