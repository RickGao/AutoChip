system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Build a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by "amount." Assume the right shit is an arithmetic right shift. 

// Signals are defined as below:
// (1) load: Loads shift register with data[63:0] instead of shifting. Active high.
// (2) ena: Chooses whether to shift. Active high. 
// (3) amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift. 
//     (a) 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit. 
//     (b) 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits. 
//     (c) 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit. 
//     (d) 2'b11: shift right by 8 bits. 
// (4) q: The contents of the shifter.
