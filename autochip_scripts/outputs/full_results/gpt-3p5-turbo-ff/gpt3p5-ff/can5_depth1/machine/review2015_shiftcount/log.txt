system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a 4-bit counter with a shift register. It has 5 inputs and 1 output. The inputs are a clock (clk), a shift enable (shift_ena), a count enable (count_ena), and data (data). The output is a 4-bit register (q).  The module is triggered by the clock signal (clk). When the clock signal is high, the module will check the two enable signals (shift_ena and count_ena). If the shift_ena signal is high, the module will shift the data input (data) into the 4-bit register (q). If the count_ena signal is high, the module will decrement the 4-bit register (q). If both enable signals are low, the module will not do anything.
