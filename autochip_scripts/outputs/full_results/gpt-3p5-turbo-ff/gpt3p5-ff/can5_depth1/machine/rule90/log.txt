system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top module is a data load module. When load is 1, it will load the data in the input data to the output q, and when load is 0, it will shift the output q to the right and adding a 0 at the end. 

input

input clk
input load
input [511:0] data

output

output reg [511:0] q

The output q is 512 bits long and is a reg type which can store the value inside.

Declaration

always @(posedge clk) begin

When the clock edge comes, the following operation will be executed.

The operation when load is 1

if (load)
	q <= data;
The input data will be loaded to the output q.

The operation when load is 0

else begin
	q <= q[$bits(q)-1:1] ^ {q[$bits(q)-2:0], 1'b0} ;
end
The last two bits of q are xored, and a 0 is added at the beginning of q.

End the operation

end
