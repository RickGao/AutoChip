system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is used to synchronize the signal d with the clock signal clk. It has three ports: clk, d, and q. The clk port is an input port for the clock signal, the d port is an input port for the signal to be synchronized, and the q port is an output port for the synchronized signal.   The module contains two registers qp and qn. The register qp is always updated with the value of d when the clock signal clk is positive. The register qn is always updated with the value of d when the clock signal clk is negative.   The output port q is assigned the value of either qp or qn depending on the value of clk. If clk is positive, q is assigned the value of qp. If clk is negative, q is assigned the value of qn. This ensures that the output signal q is synchronized with the clock signal clk.
