system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1. Since the full system doesn't ever use shift_ena and count_ena together, it does not matter what your circuit does if both control inputs are 1 (This mainly means that it doesn't matter which case gets higher priority).
