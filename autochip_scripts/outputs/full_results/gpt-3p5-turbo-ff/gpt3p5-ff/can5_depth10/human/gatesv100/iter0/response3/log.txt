{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is different from in[99].

In this solution, I have defined two intermediate wires `temp_both` and `temp_any` to hold the intermediate results. The `temp_both` wire is assigned by performing a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding bits of `in[98:0]` and `in[99:1]`. The `temp_any` wire is assigned by performing a bitwise OR operation between the corresponding bits of `in[99:1]` and `in[98:0]`. 

For the `out_different` output, I have assigned the values directly. For the bits from index 0 to 98, I have checked if the corresponding bit in `in[98:0]` is different from the next bit in `in[99:1]`. For the last bit `out_different[99]`, I have checked if `in[99]` is different from `in[0]` by treating the vector as wrapping around.

Finally, I have assigned the values of `temp_both` and `temp_any` to `out_both` and `out_any` respectively.

Please note that the code assumes that the input `in` is always of size 100 bits. If the size is different, the code needs to be modified accordingly.'}
