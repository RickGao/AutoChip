Please note that in this implementation, the state machine has been encoded using a `reg [1:0]` variable named `state`, which represents the two possible states `OFF` (state 2'b00) and `ON` (state 2'b01). The `out` signal has been declared `output reg` to allow for assignment inside the `always` block.

Also, the synchronous reset `reset` has been used to reset the state machine to its initial state `OFF` with `out` set to `0` when active-high.'}
