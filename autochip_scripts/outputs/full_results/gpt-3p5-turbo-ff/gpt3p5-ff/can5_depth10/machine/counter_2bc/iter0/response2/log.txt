{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a state machine that transitions between states based on the values of two inputs. The inputs are a clock signal, "clk", an asynchronous reset signal, "areset", a valid signal, "train_valid", and a taken signal, "train_taken". The output is a two-bit signal, "state", which represents the current state of the machine.  The state machine transitions between four states, 0, 1, 2, and 3, which are represented by the two-bit output. When the asynchronous reset signal is asserted, the state machine is reset to state 1. When the valid signal is asserted, the state machine transitions between states based on the taken signal. If the taken signal is asserted and the current state is less than 3, the state machine transitions to the next state. If the taken signal is not asserted and the current state is greater than 0, the state machine transitions to the previous state. Otherwise, the state machine remains in its current state.\n\nmodule top_module(\n    input clk,\n    input areset,\n    input train_valid,\n    input train_taken,\n    output logic [1:0] state\n);'}
