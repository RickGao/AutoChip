system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top module is a combinational logic circuit that takes in four inputs (a, b, c, d) and produces two outputs (out_sop, out_pos). The out_sop output is a Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression of the inputs, and out_pos is a Product-of-Sums (POS) expression of the inputs.   The out_sop output is generated by taking the logical AND of input c and d, and then taking the logical OR of the result with the logical AND of the logical NOT of input a, the logical NOT of input b, and input c.   The out_pos output is generated by first taking the logical AND of inputs c, the logical OR of the logical NOT of input b and input d, and the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input b. This result is assigned to the wire pos0. Then, the same logical AND is done, but with the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input d. This result is assigned to the wire pos1. Finally, the out_pos output is assigned to the result of a ternary expression that checks if pos0 and pos1 are equal, and if so, assigns out_pos to pos0, otherwise assigns out_pos to 1'bx (unknown).
