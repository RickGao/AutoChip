{'role': 'user', 'content': "//  This Verilog module is a top-level module that takes in an input vector of 256 bits (in) and an 8-bit selection vector (sel) and outputs a single bit (out).

The output bit is the bit from the input vector that corresponds to the selection vector. For example, if the selection vector is '10101010' (binary), the output bit will be the 8th bit of the input vector.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [255:0] in,\n\tinput [7:0] sel,\n\toutput  out\n);"}
