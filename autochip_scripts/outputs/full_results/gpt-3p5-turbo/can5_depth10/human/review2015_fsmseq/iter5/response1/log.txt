This updated module adds a new state, S5, to represent the detection of the sequence 1101. As soon as the sequence is detected, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1. Additionally, I have made changes to reset the `start_shifting` output to 0 by default in the `always @*` block. This should resolve the issues with the simulation and ensure that the output matches the expected behavior.'}
