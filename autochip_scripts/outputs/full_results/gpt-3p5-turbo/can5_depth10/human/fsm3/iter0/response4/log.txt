This code implements the given Moore state machine with a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset. The states are defined using an enumeration. The output is assigned based on the current state. The state transition and output logic are implemented using combinational always blocks. The next state is updated based on the current state and input, and the output is assigned to the output register. The module has input ports for clk (clock), in (input), areset (asynchronous reset), and an output port for the FSM output.'}
