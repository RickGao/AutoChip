{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

In this module, the finite state machine has three states: WALK_LEFT (00), WALK_RIGHT (01), and FALLING (10). At the beginning, the Lemming machine is reset to the WALK_LEFT state.

The output signals walk_left, walk_right, and aaah are assigned according to the current state. When state is WALK_LEFT, walk_left is set to 1, walk_right and aaah are set to 0. When state is WALK_RIGHT, walk_right is set to 1, walk_left and aaah are set to 0. When state is FALLING, aaah is set to 1, walk_left and walk_right are set to 0.

In the combinational block, the next_state is determined based on the current state and input signals. If bump_right is asserted in WALK_LEFT state, the next_state becomes WALK_RIGHT. If bump_left is asserted in WALK_RIGHT state, the next_state becomes WALK_LEFT. If ground is deasserted in either WALK_LEFT or WALK_RIGHT state, the next_state becomes FALLING. If ground is reasserted in FALLING state, the next_state becomes WALK_LEFT if the previous state was WALK_LEFT, otherwise it becomes WALK_RIGHT.'}
