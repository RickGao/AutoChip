{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a top-level module which is used to write data to a 16-bit register. It has five inputs and one output. The inputs are a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (resetn), a 2-bit byte enable signal (byteena), and a 16-bit data signal (d). The output is a 16-bit register (q).  The module is triggered by a rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is low, the register is reset to 0. Otherwise, the data signal is written to the register based on the byte enable signal. If the first bit of the byte enable signal is high, the lower 8 bits of the data signal are written to the lower 8 bits of the register. If the second bit of the byte enable signal is high, the upper 8 bits of the data signal are written to the upper 8 bits of the register.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput [1:0] byteena,\n\tinput [15:0] d,\n\toutput reg [15:0] q);'}
