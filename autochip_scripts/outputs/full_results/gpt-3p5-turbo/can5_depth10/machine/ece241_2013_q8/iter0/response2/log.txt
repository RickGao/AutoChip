This is the corrected Verilog module that implements the specified state machine and the associated output logic. The module includes a clock input (`clk`), asynchronous reset input (`aresetn`), input `x`, and output register `z`. The module uses an enumerated type `state_t` to define the states as `S`, `S1`, and `S10`. The state registers `state` and `state_next` keep track of the current and next states, respectively. The module also includes two always blocks to handle state transition and output assignments.'}
