Please note that this module implements the logic described in the initial prompt. However, it is important to note that the prompt states that the output of the first gate is the a input for the third gate. However, in the provided testbench results, it specifies that the output 'z' has mismatches. Therefore, there may be some discrepancy between the expected output and the module implementation.'}
