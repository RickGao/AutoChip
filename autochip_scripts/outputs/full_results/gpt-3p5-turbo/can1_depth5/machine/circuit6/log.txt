system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a top-level module that takes in a 3-bit input 'a' and outputs a 16-bit register 'q'. The module uses an always block to continuously check the input 'a' and assign the corresponding value to the output 'q'. The always block uses a case statement to check the value of 'a' and assign the corresponding value to 'q'. If 'a' is 0, then 'q' is assigned the value 4658. If 'a' is 1, then 'q' is assigned the value 44768. If 'a' is 2, then 'q' is assigned the value 10196. If 'a' is 3, then 'q' is assigned the value 23054. If 'a' is 4, then 'q' is assigned the value 8294. If 'a' is 5, then 'q' is assigned the value 25806. If 'a' is 6, then 'q' is assigned the value 50470. Finally, if 'a' is 7, then 'q' is assigned the value 12057.
