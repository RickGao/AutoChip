system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The reset input initializes the state to A. The top module has a clock, a reset, an input, and an output. The input x is the current input and the output z is the output of the module. The output is high when the state is D or E. The internal state is represented by 3 bits, so there are 8 states. The case statement describes the state transition when x is high or low. If the state is A and x is low, then the next state is also A. If the state is A and x is high, then the next state is B. If the state is B and x is low, then the next state is B. If the state is B and x is high, then the next state is E. If the state is C and x is low, then the next state is C. If the state is C and x is high, then the next state is B. If the state is D and x is low, then the next state is B. If the state is D and x is high, then the next state is C. If the state is E and x is low, then the next state is D. If the state is E and x is high, then the next state is E.
