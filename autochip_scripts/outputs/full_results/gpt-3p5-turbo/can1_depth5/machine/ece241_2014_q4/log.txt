system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.

The top module has the following inputs and outputs
Inputs: clk and x
Outputs: z

The following registers are defined
Register s is 3 bits and its inital value is 0

The following operations are performed
Always block
	Cascade notation is used to represent the state of s
	The first element is the MSB of s 
	The second element is the middle bit of s 
	The third element is the LSB of s 
	The following statements are implemented in the always block
		Statement 1:
			The MSB of s is s[2]
			The value of x is exlusive ORed with the MSB of s
			The value of x is also assigned to the LSB of s
		Statement 2:
			The middle bit of s is s[1]
			The NOT operator is applied to the middle bit of s
			The value of x is ANDed with the output of the NOT operator
			The output of the AND operation is assigned to the middle bit of s
		Statement 3:
			The LSB of s is s[0]
			The NOT operator is applied to the LSB of s
			The value of x is ORed with the output of the NOT operator
			The output of the OR operation is assigned to the LSB of s
	
Assign output z
	The OR operator is applied to all bits of s
	The NOT operator is applied to the output of the OR operator
	The output of the NOT operator is assigned to output z
