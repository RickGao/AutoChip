system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  The top module is a state machine that has three inputs (clk, reset, and w) and one output (z). The clk input is a clock signal that is used to synchronize the state transitions. The reset input is a synchronous reset signal that is used to reset the state machine to its initial state. The w input is an input signal that is used to control the state transitions. The z output is an output signal that is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state E or F.  The state machine has six states, A, B, C, D, E, and F, which are represented by a 3-bit register called state. The state transitions are determined by the w input and the current state. The next state is determined by a combinational logic block that is implemented using a case statement. If the w input is 0, the state transitions from A to A, from B to D, from C to D, from D to A, from E to D, and from F to D. If the w input is 1, the state transitions from A to B, from B to C, from C to E, from D to F, from E to E, and from F to C.  The output z is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state E or F. This is implemented by an assign statement that sets the z output to 1 when the state register is equal to either E or F.
