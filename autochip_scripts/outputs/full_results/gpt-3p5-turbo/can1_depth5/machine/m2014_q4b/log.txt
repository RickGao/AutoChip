system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple register with an asynchronous reset. It has three inputs, clk, d, and ar, and one output, q. The clk input is the clock signal which is used to synchronize the register. The d input is the data that will be stored in the register. The ar input is the asynchronous reset signal which will reset the register to 0. The q output is the output of the register which will be the value stored in the register.  The module has an always block which is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal or the asynchronous reset signal. When the asynchronous reset signal is triggered, the output q is set to 0. Otherwise, when the clock signal is triggered, the output q is set to the value of the data input d. This allows the register to store the value of the data input d until the asynchronous reset signal is triggered.
