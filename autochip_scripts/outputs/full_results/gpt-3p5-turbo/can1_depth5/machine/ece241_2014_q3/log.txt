system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a 4-to-1 multiplexer. It takes two inputs, c and d, and outputs a 4-bit signal mux_in. The output of the multiplexer is determined by the values of the two inputs. The output of the multiplexer is assigned to the 4-bit signal mux_in. The first bit of mux_in is assigned to the logical OR of the two inputs, c and d. The second bit of mux_in is assigned to 0. The third bit of mux_in is assigned to the logical NOT of the input d. The fourth bit of mux_in is assigned to the logical AND of the two inputs, c and d.
