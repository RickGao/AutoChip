{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state. The output z is high when the state machine is in state E or F, and is low otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput w,\n\toutput z\n);'}
