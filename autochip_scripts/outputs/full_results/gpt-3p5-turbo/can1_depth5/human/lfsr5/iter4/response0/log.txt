{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset the LFSR output to 1.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [4:0] q);'}

The issue in the previous module was with the calculation of tap2. It should be XORed with state[3] instead of state[0]. This change fixes the issue with the testbench mismatches.'}
