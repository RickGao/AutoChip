`timescale 1ns/1ps

This warning occurs because there is no timescale directive specified in the module. To fix this, you can add a `timescale directive at the beginning of the module. The `timescale directive sets the time unit and time precision for the module. In the example above, the directive sets the time unit to 1ns and the time precision to 1ps. Adjust the time values according to your desired simulation resolution.'}
