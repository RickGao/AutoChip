{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

In the above code, I have implemented a Moore finite state machine with two states (`walking_left` and `walking_right`), two inputs (`bump_left` and `bump_right`), and one internal output (`internal`). The `areset` input is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset signal.

The `state` register stores the current state of the machine, and it gets updated based on the inputs and current state. The `internal` register holds the output value that determines the direction of the Lemming.

In the `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block, I have implemented the state transition logic using a case statement. Depending on the current state and the inputs, the state machine transitions to the appropriate next state. If both `bump_left` and `bump_right` are high, or if either of them is high, the state machine switches direction. Otherwise, it continues in the same direction.

In the `always @(state)` block, I have implemented the output logic based on the current state. If the state is `walking_left`, the `internal` output is set to 1 (walk left), and if the state is `walking_right`, the `internal` output is set to 0 (walk right).

Finally, I have assigned the values of `internal` to the module outputs `walk_left` and `walk_right` using `assign` statements.

Please note that I have assumed the initial state to be `walking_left` (state `10`), as specified in the problem statement. If the initial state needs to be different, please let me know and I can make the necessary modifications.'}
