The error in the testbench is likely due to the fact that 'out' is being checked for mismatches during every clock cycle. However, the assignment of 'out' in the always block for reset occurs only once when the reset is asserted. To fix this, I added a sensitivity list for 'reset' in the second always block. This ensures that 'out' is updated only when there is a posedge of either 'clk' or 'reset'.'}
