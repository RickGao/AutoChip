system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a state machine that has four states, A, B, C, and D. The input port 'in' is a single bit signal that is used to control the state transitions. The 'state' port is a two bit signal that is used to represent the current state of the state machine. The 'next_state' port is a two bit signal that is used to represent the next state of the state machine. The 'out' port is a single bit signal that is used to indicate when the state machine is in state D.   The always_comb block is used to define the state transitions. It uses a case statement to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the value of the 'in' signal. If the current state is A and the 'in' signal is high, the next state is B. If the 'in' signal is low, the next state remains A. Similarly, if the current state is B and the 'in' signal is high, the next state is B. If the 'in' signal is low, the next state is C. If the current state is C and the 'in' signal is high, the next state is D. If the 'in' signal is low, the next state is A. Finally, if the current state is D and the 'in' signal is high, the next state is B. If the 'in' signal is low, the next state is C.   The 'out' signal is assigned to be high when the state machine is in state D. This allows the user to detect when the state machine is in state D.
