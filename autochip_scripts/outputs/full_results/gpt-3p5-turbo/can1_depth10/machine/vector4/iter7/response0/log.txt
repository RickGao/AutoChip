{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a simple combinational circuit that takes an 8-bit input and produces a 32-bit output.

This module does not contain any instantiated modules or state transitions, so the functionality is straightforward. The input is connected directly to the output, with the 8-bit input being replicated 24 times.
