system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple 16-bit to 8-bit splitter. It takes a 16-bit input signal, "in", and splits it into two 8-bit signals, "out_hi" and "out_lo". The two 8-bit signals are the upper and lower 8 bits of the original 16-bit signal, respectively. The module does not contain any logic, it simply assigns the two 8-bit signals to the 16-bit input signal. This module is useful when splitting a 16-bit signal into two 8-bit signals is necessary.
