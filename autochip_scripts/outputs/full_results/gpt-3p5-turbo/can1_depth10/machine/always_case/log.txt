system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a multiplexer which takes in 6 data inputs (data0-data5) and a selection input (sel) and outputs a single data output (out). The selection input (sel) is a 3-bit number which determines which of the 6 data inputs is selected as the output. If the selection input is 0, then the output will be the data0 input. If the selection input is 1, then the output will be the data1 input, and so on. If the selection input is any other value, then the output will be 0. The output is a 4-bit register which will hold the value of the selected data input until the selection input is changed.
