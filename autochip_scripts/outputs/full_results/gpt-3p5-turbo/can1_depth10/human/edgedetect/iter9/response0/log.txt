```verilog
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [7:0] pedge);

	reg [7:0] in_previous;

	always @(posedge clk) begin

				pedge[i] <= 1;
		end
	end

endmodule
```

In this module, a register `in_previous` is added to store the previous value of the input vector `in`. Inside the `always` block, this register is updated with the current value of `in` at each positive edge of the clock. Then, a for loop is used to iterate over each bit of the input vector and check for a 0 to 1 transition. If such a transition is detected, the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output register is set to 1.'}
