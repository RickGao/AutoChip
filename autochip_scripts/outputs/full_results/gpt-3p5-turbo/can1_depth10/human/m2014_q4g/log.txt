system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Implement in Verilog the following circuit: A two-input XNOR (connected to 'in1' and 'in2) has an output connected to the input of a two-input XOR. The second input of the XOR is 'in3.' The output of the XOR is 'out'.
