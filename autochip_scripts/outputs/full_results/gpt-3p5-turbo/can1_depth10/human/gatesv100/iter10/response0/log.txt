{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].\n\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [99:0] in,\n\toutput [98:0] out_both,\n\toutput [99:1] out_any,\n\toutput [99:0] out_different\n);"}
