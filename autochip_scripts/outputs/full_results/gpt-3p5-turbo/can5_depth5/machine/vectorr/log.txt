system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a 8-bit unidirectional data port. It takes an 8-bit input in, and outputs an 8-bit signal out. The output of the module is assigned to out based on the value of in. If in = {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}, then out = {h,g,f,e,d,c,b,a}.
