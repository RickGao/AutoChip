system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple combinational circuit that takes an 8-bit input and produces a 32-bit output. The output is formed by replicating the 8-bit input 24 times and then concatenating it with the original 8-bit input. This module does not contain any instantiated modules or state transitions, so the functionality is straightforward. The input is connected directly to the output, with the 8-bit input being replicated 24 times. The output is 32 bits wide, with the first 24 bits being the replicated input and the last 8 bits being the original input.
