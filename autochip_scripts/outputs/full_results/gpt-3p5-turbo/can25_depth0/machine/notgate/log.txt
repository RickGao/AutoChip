system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple combinational circuit that takes an input and produces an inverted output. The input port is named "in" and the output port is named "out". The output is assigned to the inverse of the input, meaning that if the input is 0, the output will be 1, and if the input is 1, the output will be 0. This module does not have any internal logic or state transitions, it simply takes the input and inverts it.

module top_module(
	input in,
	output out
);
assistant: module top_module(
	input in,
	output out
);
	assign out = ~in;
