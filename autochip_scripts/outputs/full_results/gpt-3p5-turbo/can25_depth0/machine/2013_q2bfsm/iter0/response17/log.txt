This code implements the FSM machine as described in the specifications. The current state and next state variables are defined as an enumeration, and the state transitions and output assignments are performed based on the current state and inputs (`x` and `y`). The `resetn` signal is used to reset the FSM to the initial state (`A`) and clear the outputs (`f` and `g`).'}
