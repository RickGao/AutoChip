The first layer, counting from the input, is two AND gates: one whose input is connected to a and b, and the second is connected to c and d.

In this solution, I have created two intermediate wires `intermediate1` and `intermediate2` to connect the AND gates to the OR gate. The AND gates are connected to inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The output of the AND gates are connected to the OR gate, and the output wires `out` and `out_n` are connected to the OR gate output and the output of a NOT gate, respectively.'}
