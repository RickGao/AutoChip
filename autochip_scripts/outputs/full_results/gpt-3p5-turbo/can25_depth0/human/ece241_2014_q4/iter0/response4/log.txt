The module consists of three D flip-flops and a three-input XNOR gate. The input `x` is connected to the data input of each D flip-flop, and the output of each flip-flop is used as one of the inputs to the XNOR gate. The other inputs of the XNOR gate are the complemented outputs of the corresponding flip-flops. The output `z` is driven by the XNOR gate.

Note that in this solution, we assume that the module `DFF` for the D flip-flop and the module `XNOR` for the XNOR gate are available. If these modules are not provided, you will need to define them separately.'}
