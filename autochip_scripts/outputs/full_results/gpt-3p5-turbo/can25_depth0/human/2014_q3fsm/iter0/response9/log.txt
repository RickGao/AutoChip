In this Verilog module, I have implemented a finite state machine (FSM) based on the given specifications. The module has four inputs: `clk` for the clock signal, `reset` for the synchronous reset signal, `s` for input s, and `w` for input w. The module also has an output `z`, which is a registered output.

The module uses two states: state A and state B. In state A, the FSM remains in the reset state as long as `s` is 0. When `s` is 1, the FSM transitions to state B. In state B, the FSM examines the value of `w` over the next three clock cycles using a counter `count`. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of those clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM continues checking `w` for the next three clock cycles and repeats the process.

A synchronous reset is implemented using an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal or the positive edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is active high, the FSM will reset its state and count variables to their initial values.

The FSM's next state logic is implemented using an `always_comb` block. Depending on the current state, the module determines the next state and updates the output `z` accordingly. State transitions are performed based on the values of `s` and `count`.

Please note that this is just one possible implementation. There may be other valid ways to implement this FSM with different state encoding and logic.'}
