Please note that the state enumeration `state` is defined using `typedef enum`. The `current_state` and `next_state` registers hold the current and next states, respectively. The state transition logic is implemented using a `case` statement within an `always_comb` block. The output assignment is also implemented using a `case` statement within an `always` block with sensitivity to `current_state`. The output `out` is declared as a `reg` since it is assigned within an `always` block.'}
