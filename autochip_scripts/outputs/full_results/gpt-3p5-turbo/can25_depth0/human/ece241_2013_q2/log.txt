system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // A single-output digital system with four inputs (a,b,c,d) generates a logic-1 when 2, 7, or 15 appears on the inputs, and a logic-0 when 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14 appears. The input conditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 never occur in this system. For example, 7 corresponds to a,b,c,d being set to 0,1,1,1, respectively. Determine the output out_sop in minimum sum-of-products form, and the output out_pos in minimum product-of-sums form.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your circuit passes on the 12 required input combinations, but doesn't match the don't-care cases. Are you using minimal SOP and POS?
