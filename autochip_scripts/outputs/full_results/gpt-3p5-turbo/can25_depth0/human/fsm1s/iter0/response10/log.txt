This module implements a Moore state machine with two states, one input (`in`), and one output (`out`).

The reset state is `B` and the reset is active-high synchronous. The output `out` is set to 1 when the state is `B` and it is set to 0 when the state is `A`.

The state transitions are as follows:

1. When the current state is `B`:
   - If the input `in` is 0, the next state is `A`.
   - If the input `in` is 1, the next state is `B`.

2. When the current state is `A`:
   - If the input `in` is 0, the next state is `B`.
   - If the input `in` is 1, the next state is `A`.

The output `out` is assigned based on the current state. If the current state is `B`, `out` is assigned to 1; otherwise, it is assigned to 0.

Note: The module assumes that the input `in` and the output `out` are synchronous to the clock `clk`.'}
