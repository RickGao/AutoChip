{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a four-bit input vector in[3:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] should indicate if in[2] and in[3] are both 1. Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[2] should indicate if in[2] is different from in[3]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[3]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput [2:0] out_both,\n\toutput [3:1] out_any,\n\toutput [3:0] out_different\n);"}
