This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine for recognizing the three sequences described:

1. When the input sequence is 0111110, the `disc` output signal is asserted for a complete cycle.
2. When the input sequence is 01111110, the `flag` output signal is asserted for a complete cycle.
3. When the input sequence is 01111111..., representing 7 or more consecutive 1s, the `err` output signal is asserted for a complete cycle.

The FSM is resettable and goes to an initial state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous.'}
