{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  the top module to the output of the stimulus_gen module. The top module is the module that is being tested.  \tThe top module contains two inputs, a clock and a reset. The clock is used to synchronize the logic of the module. The reset is used to reset the state of the module. The module also contains two outputs, a data output and a valid output. The data output is used to output the data that is being processed by the module, and the valid output is used to indicate when the data output is valid.  \tThe top module also contains two internal signals, a state and a counter. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the module, and the counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have passed since the last reset.  \tThe top module is a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The idle state is the initial state of the module, and is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In the idle state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0.  \tWhen the clock signal is asserted, the FSM transitions to the wait state. In the wait state, the counter is incremented and the data output is set to 0. The FSM remains in the wait state until the counter reaches a certain threshold, at which point it transitions to the process state.  \tIn the process state, the data output is set to the data that is being processed by the module. The FSM then transitions to the done state. In the done state, the valid output is asserted to indicate that the data output is valid. The FSM then transitions back to the idle state.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput in,\n\toutput out);'}
