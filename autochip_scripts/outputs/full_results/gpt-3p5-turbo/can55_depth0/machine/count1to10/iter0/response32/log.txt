It has 3 inputs, a clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and an output register (q). The output register is a 4-bit register, meaning it can store values from 0 to 15.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the output register is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active, the output register is incremented by one. When the output register reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it is reset to 1. This process is repeated every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [3:0] q);'}
