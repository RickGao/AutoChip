This code provides the corrected top module based on the given specifications. The required signals are assigned based on the given conditions. The outputs B3_next, S_next, S1_next, Count_next, and Wait_next are determined using the respective conditions. The shift_ena signal is determined by checking if any of the B states are active. The done and counting signals are set based on the current state. Some additional wires are used to check for active B states.'}
