This is the completed Verilog module that implements the two-state state machine described. The module has been defined with the specified inputs (clk, j, k, reset) and output (out). The current state and next state signals are created as reg [1:0] variables. The current state is initialized to state A when the reset input is high. The next state is determined based on the current state and the inputs j and k. The output is set to high when the current state is B and low when the current state is A.'}
