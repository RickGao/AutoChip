This module implements the two-state state machine with the described behavior. The state is stored in a two-bit register, with state A represented as 2'b00 and state B represented as 2'b01. When the reset input is high, the state is set to A. When the reset input is low, the module transitions between states based on the inputs j and k, as described. The output out is set to 0 when the state is A, and 1 when the state is B.'}
