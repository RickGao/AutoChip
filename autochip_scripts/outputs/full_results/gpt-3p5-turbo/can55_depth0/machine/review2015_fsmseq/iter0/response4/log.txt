{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a state machine that controls the state of the data within a shift register. The module has 4 ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), a data input (data), and an output (start_shifting). The module has 5 states: S, S1, S11, S110, and Done. The module is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the data input. If the current state is S, and the data input is high, then the next state will be S1. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S1, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S11, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S110. If the current state is S110, and the data input is high, the next state will be Done. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is Done, the next state will be Done.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (S) on the rising edge of the reset signal. The output of the state machine is assigned based on the current state of the state machine. The output will be high if the state is Done, and low otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n\toutput start_shifting);'}
