Here's the complete corrected module. A separate module called `fsm_module` has been created to implement the FSM logic. The inputs `x` and `y` have been added to the sensitivity list of the second `always` block to ensure correct behavior. The outputs `f` and `g` have been declared as `reg` types and assigned their values correctly based on the current state.'}
