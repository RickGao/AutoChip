This module defines a finite state machine with three states (S, S1, S10) and updates the state based on the input x. The output z is determined based on the current state.

Please note that this code assumes that clk is the clock signal and aresetn is the asynchronous reset signal. The module uses synchronous positive edge clocking and asynchronous active low reset.'}
