Note: In this implementation, when the reset signal `areset` is asserted (0) the state machine is in the reset state (`S0`) and the output `z` is set to 0. When the reset is released (1), the state machine transitions to state `S1` and the output `z` is set to the 2's complement of the input `x` using the formula `~x + 1'b1`.'}
