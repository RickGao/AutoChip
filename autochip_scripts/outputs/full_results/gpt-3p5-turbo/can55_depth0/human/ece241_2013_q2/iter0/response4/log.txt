Explanation:

The output `out_sop` is set to 1 when the input is 2, 7 or 15. Therefore, we use a sum-of-products expression to create the logic. The inputs that correspond to each number are as follows:
- For 2: a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0
- For 7: a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1
- For 15: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1

To express this logic in minimum sum-of-products form, we use AND and NOT gates. The expression `(a & ~b & c & d) | (~a & b & ~c & ~d) | (a & ~b & ~c & ~d)` corresponds to these input conditions.

The output `out_pos` is set to 0 when the input is 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 or 14. Therefore, we use a product-of-sums expression to create the logic. The inputs that correspond to each number are as follows:
- For 0: a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0
- For 1: a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1
- For 4: a = 0, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0
- For 5: a = 0, b = 0, c = 1, d = 1
- For 6: a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0
- For 9: a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1
- For 10: a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0
- For 13: a = 1, b = 1, c = 0, d = 1
- For 14: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0

To express this logic in minimum product-of-sums form, we use OR and NOT gates. The expression `(~a & ~b & c & ~d) & (~a & b & c & ~d) & (~a & ~b & ~c & ~d) & (~a & b & ~c & d) & (~a & b & c & d) & (a & b & c & ~d) & (a & ~b & c & ~d) & (a & ~b & ~c & d) & (a & b & ~c & ~d)` corresponds to these input conditions.
