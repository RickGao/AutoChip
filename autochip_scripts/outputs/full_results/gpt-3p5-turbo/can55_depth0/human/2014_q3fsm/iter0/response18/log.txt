In this module, a 2-bit state register `state` is used to store the current state of the finite state machine (FSM). The `A` state is represented by `2'b00` and the `B` state is represented by `2'b01`. The `state` register is updated at every positive edge of the `clk` signal.

The FSM has an additional signal `w_count` which is a 3-bit counter that keeps track of the number of consecutive clock cycles during which `w` is equal to 1. This counter helps to determine when `z` should be set to 1.

Inside the `always` block, there is a case statement that handles the transitions between states based on the current state and input conditions.

In state `A`, if `s` is equal to 1, the next state is set to `B`. Otherwise, the next state remains in `A`.

In state `B`, if `w` is equal to 1, the `w_count` is incremented by 1. If `w_count` reaches the value of `3'b10`, indicating that `w` has been equal to 1 for exactly two clock cycles, `z` is set to 1. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. If `w` is equal to 0, `w_count` is reset to 0. The next state remains in `B`.

By default, if the FSM is in any other state besides `A` or `B`, it is reset to state `A`.

The initial values of the registers are set in the `reset` block. When `reset` is true, the FSM is reset to state `A`, `w_count` is reset to 0, and `z` is set to 0.

Note that the `z` output is declared as a `reg` type since it is assigned inside the `always` block, and it is set to 0 in the `reset` block.

Finally, the `top_module` is defined with the specified inputs (`clk`, `reset`, `s`, `w`) and output (`z`).'}
