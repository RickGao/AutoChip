{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions.

This Verilog module implements a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and two outputs. The module models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings, where the Lemming can be in one of two states (walking left or walking right) and switches directions if it hits an obstacle. The `areset` input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state of walking left. The `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs indicate if the Lemming has been bumped on the left or right side respectively. The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs indicate whether the Lemming should be walking left or right.'}
