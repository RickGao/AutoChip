Above is a complete module that implements a full adder. The module includes the necessary inputs and outputs, as specified in the problem statement. The internal wires `s1`, `c1`, and `c2` are used to represent intermediate signals within the adder circuit. The module uses three gates: `xor_gate`, `and_gate`, and `or_gate`, which are assumed to be defined elsewhere. The module follows a two-stage implementation, where the sum is computed in the first stage (using a half adder), and the final carry-out is computed in the second stage (using a full adder). The correct outputs `sum` and `cout` are declared and assigned in the `endmodule` section.'}
