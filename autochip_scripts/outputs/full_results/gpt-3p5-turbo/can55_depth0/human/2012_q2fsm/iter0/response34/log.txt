The module `top_module` represents the given FSM. It has four input ports: `clk`, `reset`, `w`, and one output port `z`. The `clk` port is the clock input, `reset` is the synchronous active high reset input, `w` is the input that determines the next state based on the current state and `z` is the output representing the FSM output.

The module uses two always blocks: one for the state flip-flops and one for the state table. The state flip-flop always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset signal. It updates the current state to the next state. When the reset signal is high, the current state is set to state A, otherwise, it is updated to the calculated next state.

The state table always block uses a case statement to calculate the next state based on the current state and the input `w` or `z`. Each case corresponds to a state and determines the next state based on the current state and the input. 

Another always block updates the FSM output `z` based on the current state. It is also triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is high, the output `z` is set to 0, otherwise, it is updated based on the current state. In the case of state A, the output `z` is always 0. In the case of state E, the output `z` is always 1. If there are any other states with specific output assignments, they can be added to this always block.

The parameters `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are used to represent the states as binary codes. These codes can be changed if desired.'}
