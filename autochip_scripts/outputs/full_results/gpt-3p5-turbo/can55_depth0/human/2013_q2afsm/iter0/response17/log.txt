This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures. Describe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion).

Explanation:
- The module `top_module` represents the FSM that controls the arbiter circuit.
- The input signals `clk`, `resetn`, and `r` represent the clock, the active-low synchronous reset, and the resource request signals from the three devices, respectively.
- The output signals `g` represent the grants given to each device.
- The FSM has four states, A, B, C, and D, which are represented using two bits (2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, and 2'b11, respectively).
- The state flip-flop is driven by the clock and reset signal.
- The state table determines the next state based on the current state and the input resource request signals.
- The output assignments use continuous assignment statements to determine the grants given to each device based on the current state. Device 1 has a higher priority than Device 2, and Device 3 has the lowest priority.
- The completed Verilog module correctly represents the given FSM and assigns the grants to each device according to the provided priority system.'}
