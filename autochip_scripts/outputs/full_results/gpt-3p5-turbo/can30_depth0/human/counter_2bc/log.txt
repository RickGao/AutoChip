system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Build a two-bit saturating counter. The counter increments (up to a maximum of 3) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1. It decrements (down to a minimum of 0) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0. When not training (train_valid = 0), the counter keeps its value unchanged. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the counter to weakly not-taken (2'b01). Output state[1:0] is the two-bit counter value.
