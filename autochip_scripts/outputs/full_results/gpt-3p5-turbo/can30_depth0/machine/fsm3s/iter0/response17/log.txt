The code above implements the FSM as described in the problem statement. The module has a 2-bit register `state` to hold the current state. The state transitions are defined using a case statement inside the `always` block that triggers on the rising edge of the `clk` signal and the rising edge of the `reset` signal. The output `out` is assigned a value of 1 when the state is D using a conditional assignment.'}
