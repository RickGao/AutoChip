In the DONE state, the module checks the third bit of the input again. If it is 0, the state machine transitions back to the BYTE1 state.

In this Verilog module, the state machine is implemented using a 3-bit register called "state". The "reset" signal is used to initialize the state machine to the BYTE1 state. The state machine transitions between states based on the value of the "in[2]" signal.

The "done" signal is asserted when the state machine is in the DONE state and deasserted in all other states.'}
