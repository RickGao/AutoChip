system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple combinational logic circuit that has one input (a) and one output (q). It is triggered by a clock signal (clk) and has a register (q) that stores the output value. The module uses a positive edge triggered always block to implement the logic. When the clock signal goes from low to high, the output q is set to the inverse of the input a. This means that when the input a is high, the output q will be low and vice versa. The module will continuously update the output q whenever the clock signal changes from low to high.
