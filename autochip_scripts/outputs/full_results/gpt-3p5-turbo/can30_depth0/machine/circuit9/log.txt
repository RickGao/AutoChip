system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top Verilog module is a Mealy machine with two inputs (clk and a) and one output (q).
The output q is a 3-bit value.
The input a is an activity signal.
When a is 1, q is set to 4.
When a is 0 and q is 6, q is set to 0.
When a is 0 and q is not 6, q is increased by 1.
