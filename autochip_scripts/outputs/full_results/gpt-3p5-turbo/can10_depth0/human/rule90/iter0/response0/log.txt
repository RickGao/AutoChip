{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0].
