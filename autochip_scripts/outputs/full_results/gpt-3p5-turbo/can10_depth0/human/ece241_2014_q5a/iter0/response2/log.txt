In this corrected module:
- The output `z` is declared as a `reg` type.
- Two registers `state` and `next_state` are added to keep track of the current state and the next state of the Moore state machine.
- An asynchronous reset logic is added to synchronize the state transition.
- The `case` statement is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `x`.
- The output `z` is updated based on the current state and the input `x`. In state 0, `z` is directly assigned as `x`. In state 1, `z` is assigned as the 2's complement of `x`. In state 2, `z` remains unchanged.'}
