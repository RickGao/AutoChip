Explanation: 
This is a Finite State Machine (FSM) with 4 states A (2'b00), B (2'b01), C (2'b10), D (2'b11), and the initial state is A. The FSM changes state based on the inputs in, clk, and reset. 
When the reset input is 1, the FSM resets to state A (2'b00). 
The FSM transitions from state A to state B if the input in is 1; otherwise, it remains in state A. 
The FSM transitions from state B to state B if the input in is 1; otherwise, it transitions to state C. 
The FSM transitions from state C to state D if the input in is 1; otherwise, it transitions to state A. 
The FSM transitions from state D to state B if the input in is 1; otherwise, it transitions to state C. 
The output out is 1 when the state is D (2'b11); otherwise, it is 0.'}
