{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a simple counter. It has four ports: clk, load, data, and tc. The clk port is an input port that is used to clock the counter. The load port is an input port that is used to determine whether the counter should be loaded with a new value. The data port is an input port that is used to provide the new value to the counter when the load port is asserted. The tc port is an output port that is used to indicate when the counter has reached 0.  The module contains an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clk port. Inside the always block, there is an if-else statement that is used to control the counter. If the load port is asserted, then the counter is loaded with the value from the data port. Otherwise, if the counter is not already at 0, then the counter is decremented by 1.  Finally, the tc port is assigned to the result of the comparison between the counter value and 0. When the counter value is 0, the tc port is asserted.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk, \n\tinput load, \n\tinput [9:0] data, \n\toutput tc\n);'}
