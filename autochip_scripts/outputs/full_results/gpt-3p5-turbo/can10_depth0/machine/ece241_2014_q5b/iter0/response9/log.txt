{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a state machine that has two states, A and B, and is used to detect a rising edge on the input x. The module has four inputs and one output. The inputs are clk, areset, and x, while the output is z. The clk input is the clock signal used to synchronize the state machine, the areset input is the asynchronous reset signal, and the x input is the signal that is being monitored for a rising edge. The output z is a signal that is set to 1 when a rising edge is detected on the x input.  The module has a parameter, A and B, which are used to define the two states of the state machine. The state of the state machine is stored in a register called state. The state machine is clocked by the posedge of the clk input. When the areset input is asserted, the state is set to A. When the areset input is not asserted, the state is determined by the case statement. If the state is A, then the state will be set to B if the x input is 1, otherwise the state will remain A. If the state is B, then the state will remain B.  The output z is set to 1 when the state is A and the x input is 1, or when the state is B and the x input is 0. Otherwise, the output z is 0.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput x,\n\toutput z\n);'}
