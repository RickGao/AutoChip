system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: 
// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. 
// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. 
// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].
