```verilog
module top_module (

This module consists of three D flip-flops `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`. The input `x` is connected to three different logic gates - an XOR gate, an AND gate, and an OR gate. The outputs of these logic gates are connected to the inputs of the flip-flops. The outputs of the flip-flops are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output `z` is assigned using the logical expression `~(d1 ^ d2 ^ d3)`.

The flip-flops are synchronous and are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The logic equations for the flip-flop inputs are as follows: `d1 <= x ^ d1`, `d2 <= ~d2 & d1`, and `d3 <= ~d3 | ~d2`.

Note that the flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins, as specified in the problem statement.'}
