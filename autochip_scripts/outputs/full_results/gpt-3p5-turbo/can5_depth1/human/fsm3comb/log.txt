system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following state encoding: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. Given the current state (state), compute the next_state and output (out) based on the state transition table.
// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
// A | A, B | 0
// B | C, B | 0
// C | A, D | 0
// D | C, B | 1
