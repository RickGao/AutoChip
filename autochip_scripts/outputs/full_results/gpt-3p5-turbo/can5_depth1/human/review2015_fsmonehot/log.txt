system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Given the following Moore state machine with 3 input (d, done_counting, ack) and 3 outputs (shift_ena, counting, done). Unless otherwise stated in the diagram below, assume outputs are 0 and inputs are don't cares.

// S () --d=0--> S
// S () --d=1--> S1
// S1 () --d=0--> S
// S1 () --d=1--> S11
// S11 () --d=0--> S110
// S11 () --d=1--> S11
// S110 () --d=0--> S

// B1 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> B2
// B2 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> B3
// B3 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> Count
// Count (counting=1) --!(done_counting)--> Count
// Count (counting=1) --(done_counting)--> Wait
// Wait (done=1) --ack=0--> Wait
// Wait (done=1) --ack=1--> S

// At reset, the state machine starts in state "S". Derive next-state logic equations and output logic equations by inspection assuming the following one-hot encoding is used: (S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, Wait) = (10'b0000000001, 10'b0000000010, 10'b0000000100, ... , 10'b1000000000)

// Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine.

// Write code that generates the following equations:

// - B3_next -- next-state logic for state B3
// - S_next
// - S1_next
// - Count_next
// - Wait_next
// - done -- output logic
// - counting
// - shift_ena
