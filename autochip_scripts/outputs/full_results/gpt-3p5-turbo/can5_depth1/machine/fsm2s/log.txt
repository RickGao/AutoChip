system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a two-state state machine with two inputs and one output. The two inputs are j and k, and the output is out. The two states are A and B, and the module is initialized to state A.   The module has a clock input, clk, and a reset input. When the reset input is high, the state is set to A. When the reset input is low, the state is determined by the two inputs j and k.   When the state is A, the next state is determined by the input j. If j is high, the next state is B. If j is low, the next state remains A. When the state is B, the next state is determined by the input k. If k is high, the next state is A. If k is low, the next state remains B.   The output out is high when the state is B, and low when the state is A.
