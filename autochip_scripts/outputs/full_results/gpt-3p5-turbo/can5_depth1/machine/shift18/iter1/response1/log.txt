The main issue in your module was in the assignments inside the case statement. Here are the corrections:

- In the case item '00', the assignment is modified to q <= {q[62:0], 6'b0}, as we need to assign 6 bits instead of just 1 bit.
- In the case item '01', the assignment is modified to q <= {q[55:0], data[7:0]}, as we need to assign data[7:0] to the lower 8 bits of q.
- In the case item '10', the assignment is modified to q <= {q[62:1], data[63]}, as we need to shift q left by 1 bit and assign data[63] to the most significant bit of q.
- In the case item '11', the assignment is modified to q <= {data[63], data[63:8]}, as we need to assign data[63:8] to the upper 56 bits of q, with data[63] being the most significant bit.

These corrections should resolve the mismatches in your testbench simulation.'}
