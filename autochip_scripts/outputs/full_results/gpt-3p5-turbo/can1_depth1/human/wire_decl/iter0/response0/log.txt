In the above code, I have defined the `top_module` as specified in the circuit diagram. Two intermediate wires, `intermediate_1` and `intermediate_2`, are created to connect the AND gates to the OR gate. The AND gates are implemented in the `and` module, the OR gate is implemented in the `or` module, and the NOT gate is implemented in the `not` module.

Note that the `not` module is instantiated directly in the `top_module` to define the inverted output `out_n` based on the output `out` of the OR gate.'}
