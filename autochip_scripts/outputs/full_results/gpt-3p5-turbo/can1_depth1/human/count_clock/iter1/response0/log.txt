{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Create a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm indicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second, while "clk" is much faster than once per second). The signal "pm" is asserted if the clock is PM, or is otherwise AM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59). Reset is the active high synchronous signal that resets the clock to "12:00 AM."
