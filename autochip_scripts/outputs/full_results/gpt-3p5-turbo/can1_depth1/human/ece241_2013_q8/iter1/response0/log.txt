```

The issue in the original code was that the reset logic was not correctly implemented. The state and z variables were not reset to their initial values when aresetn was low. I have fixed this by adding the correct reset logic in the always block.

Please re-run the simulation with this corrected code. It should resolve the issues and the simulation should run without any errors or mismatches.'}
