system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module named top has four inputs, in[3:0], and three outputs, out_and, out_or, and out_xor. The in[3:0] inputs are four bits wide. The out_and, out_or, and out_xor outputs are all single bits.   The module assigns the out_and output to the result of a logical AND operation on all of the bits in the in[3:0] inputs. The out_or output is assigned to the result of a logical OR operation on all of the bits in the in[3:0] inputs. The out_xor output is assigned to the result of a logical XOR operation on all of the bits in the in[3:0] inputs.   Therefore, the top module takes four bits as inputs and performs a logical AND, OR, and XOR operation on them, producing three single bit outputs.
