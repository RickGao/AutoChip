system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is used to add two 8-bit numbers, a and b, and output the 8-bit sum, s, and an overflow bit. The module has four ports: two 8-bit inputs, a and b, an 8-bit output, s, and an overflow output.  The module first creates an 8-bit wire, sum, which is the sum of the two inputs, a and b. It then assigns the 8-bit output, s, to the 8 least significant bits of the sum. Finally, it assigns the overflow output to a logical expression which checks if the two inputs have the same sign and if the sign of the output is different from the sign of the inputs. If both of these conditions are true, then the overflow bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.

	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	output [7:0] s,
	output overflow

    wire [7:0] sum;
    
    // Assign the sum of inputs 'a' and 'b' to the 'sum' wire
    assign sum = a + b;
    
    // Assign the 8 least significant bits of 'sum' to the output 's'
    assign s = sum[7:0];
    
    // Assign the overflow output based on the logical expression
    assign overflow = (a[7] ^ b[7]) & (s[7] ^ a[7]);
