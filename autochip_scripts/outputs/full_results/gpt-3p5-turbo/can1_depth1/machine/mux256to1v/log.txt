system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a 4-bit selector module. It takes in a 1024-bit input vector (in) and an 8-bit selection vector (sel) and outputs a 4-bit vector (out). The selection vector (sel) is used to select a 4-bit block from the input vector (in). The output vector (out) is the 4-bit block selected from the input vector (in) based on the selection vector (sel). The selection vector (sel) is used to calculate the starting index of the 4-bit block in the input vector (in). The 4-bit block is then extracted from the input vector (in) starting from the calculated index and is assigned to the output vector (out).

module top_module (
	input [1023:0] in,
	input [7:0] sel,
	output [3:0] out
);
assistant: module top_module (
	input [1023:0] in,
	input [7:0] sel,
	output [3:0] out
);
	// Wire declarations
	wire [(sel + 3):0] index; // Calculation of starting index of the 4-bit block
	wire [3:0] block; // Extracted 4-bit block from the input vector
	
	// Assigning starting index of the 4-bit block
	assign index = sel << 2;

	// Extracting the 4-bit block from the input vector based on the calculated index
	assign block = in[index +: 4];

	// Assigning the extracted 4-bit block to the output vector
	assign out = block;
