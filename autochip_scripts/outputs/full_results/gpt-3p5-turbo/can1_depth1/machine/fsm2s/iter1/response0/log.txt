The two states are A and B, and the module is initialized to state A.   The module has a clock input, clk, and a reset input. When the reset input is high, the state is set to A. When the reset input is low, the state is determined by the two inputs j and k.   When the state is A, the next state is determined by the input j. If j is high, the next state is B. If j is low, the next state remains A. When the state is B, the next state is determined by the input k. If k is high, the next state is A. If k is low, the next state remains B.
