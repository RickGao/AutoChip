system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is used to perform bitwise and logical operations on two 3-bit inputs, a and b. The module has five output ports, out_or_bitwise, out_or_logical, and out_not.  The out_or_bitwise port is used to output the bitwise OR of the two 3-bit inputs, a and b. This is done by assigning the output port to the bitwise OR of the two inputs.  The out_or_logical port is used to output the logical OR of the two 3-bit inputs, a and b. This is done by assigning the output port to the logical OR of the two inputs.  The out_not port is used to output the bitwise NOT of the two 3-bit inputs, a and b. This is done by assigning the output port to the bitwise NOT of the two inputs, in reverse order.
