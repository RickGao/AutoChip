system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a shift register with a multiplexer at the output. The module has an 8-bit register, q, and a 3-bit multiplexer. The clock, enable, and S inputs are used to control the register. When the enable signal is high, the register is enabled and the S input is shifted into the register. The A, B, and C inputs are used to select which bit of the register is output on the Z output. The A, B, and C inputs are combined to form a 3-bit address that is used to select which bit of the register is output on the Z output.
