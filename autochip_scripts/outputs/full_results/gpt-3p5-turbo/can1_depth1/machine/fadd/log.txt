system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple adder that takes three inputs (a, b, and cin) and outputs two values (cout and sum). The inputs a and b are the two numbers to be added, while cin is the carry-in bit. The output cout is the carry-out bit, and sum is the result of the addition of a and b plus the carry-in bit.   The module uses an assign statement to calculate the outputs. The assign statement adds the inputs a and b, plus the carry-in bit, and assigns the result to the outputs cout and sum. The carry-out bit is calculated by determining if the sum of the inputs is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, then the carry-out bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. The sum output is the result of the addition of a, b, and cin, modulo 2.
