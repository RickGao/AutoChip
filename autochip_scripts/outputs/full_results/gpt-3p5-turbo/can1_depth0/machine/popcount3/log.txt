system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple combinational logic module that takes three input bits and produces two output bits. The module is named top and it has three inputs, in[2:0], and two outputs, out[1:0]. The output of the module is calculated by adding the three input bits together. The result of the addition is stored in the two output bits, out[1:0]. The most significant bit of the result is stored in out[1] and the least significant bit is stored in out[0]. The module does not have any internal state and it does not use any instantiated modules.

module top_module (
	input [2:0] in,
	output [1:0] out
);
assistant: module top_module (
  input [2:0] in,
  output [1:0] out
);

  // Logic to calculate the sum of the three input bits
  assign out[1] = in[2] ^ in[1] ^ in[0];
  assign out[0] = in[2] & in[1] | in[0];
