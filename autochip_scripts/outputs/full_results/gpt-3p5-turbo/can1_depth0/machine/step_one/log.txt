system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a simple module that assigns the output one to a value of 1'b1. This means that the output one will always be set to a logic high value. This is a useful module for testing purposes, as it can be used to ensure that the logic in the rest of the circuit is functioning correctly. The output one is connected to the output of the module, and no other ports are connected. This module does not have any logic or state transitions, as it is simply assigning the output one to a constant value.

module top_module(
	output one);
assistant: module top_module(
	output reg one); // Add reg keyword to make 'one' a register

	always @* // Use always @* to infer combinational logic
	begin
		one = 1'b1; // Assign 1'b1 to 'one'
	end
endmodule
