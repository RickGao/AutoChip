system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple combinational logic circuit which implements a multiplexer. The module has five ports, four inputs and one output. The inputs are a clock signal (clk), a select signal (L), and two data inputs (q_in and r_in). The output is a single bit register (Q).  The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L). If the select signal is high, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the second data input (r_in). If the select signal is low, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the first data input (q_in).  The initial value of the output register (Q) is set to 0. This ensures that the output register is in a known state before the first rising edge of the clock signal.  The module is useful for selecting between two data inputs based on a select signal. This allows for a single output to be driven by two different sources depending on the value of the select signal.
