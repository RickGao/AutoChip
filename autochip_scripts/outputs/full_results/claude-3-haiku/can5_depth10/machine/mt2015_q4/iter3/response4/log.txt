The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should work as expected. However, the issue seems to be with the testbench. Without seeing the testbench code, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact problem. The error message indicates that there are mismatches between the expected and actual output of the module during simulation.

Some possible reasons for the mismatch could be:

1. Incorrect test input values or timing in the testbench.
2. Issues with the testbench setup, such as incorrect port connections or signal assignments.
3. Timing or delay issues in the module that are not properly captured by the testbench.

To resolve the issue, I recommend reviewing the testbench code to ensure that the input stimuli and expected output are correctly specified. You may also want to add some additional debug statements or waveform monitoring to the testbench to better understand the root cause of the mismatch.

If the issue persists, please provide the testbench code so that I can take a closer look and help you further.'}
