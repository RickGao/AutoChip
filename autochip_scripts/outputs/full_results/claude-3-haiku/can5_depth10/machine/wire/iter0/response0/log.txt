This Verilog module implements the top-level logic as described in the specification. It has two inputs (clock and reset) and two outputs (data_out and valid_out). The module uses a finite state machine with four states (IDLE, WAIT, PROCESS, and DONE) to control the data processing and output. The counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the WAIT state before transitioning to the PROCESS state. The data_out signal is set to 1 in the PROCESS state, and the valid_out signal is asserted in the DONE state to indicate that the data is valid.'}
