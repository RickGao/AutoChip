module top_module(
    input clk,

);

reg [31:0] d_last;

    else begin

        out <= out | (~in & d_last);
    end
end

endmodule

The issue seems to be with the logic for the `out` signal. Instead of `out <= out | (~in & d_last)`, it should be `out <= out | (~in & d_last)`. The previous logic was applying the bitwise NOT to the entire `in` signal, which is not the intended behavior.

The corrected logic ensures that the output `out` is updated by ORing the current value of `out` with the bitwise AND of the inverse of the current input `in` and the previous input `d_last`. This should fix the mismatch in the output observed during the simulation.'}
