This Verilog module implements the given specification. The top module has 8 inputs (clk, load, ena, amount[1:0], data[63:0]) and 2 outputs (q[63:0]). The module has one always block that is triggered by the rising edge of the clk signal.

Inside the always block, there is an if-else-if statement. The first if statement checks if the load signal is high, and in that case, it assigns the data input to the output q. The else-if statement checks if the ena signal is high, and in that case, it executes a case statement based on the amount[1:0] input.

The case statement has four case items, each performing a different operation on the output q:
- 2'b00: Shifts q left by 1 bit, filling the least significant bit with 0.
- 2'b01: Sets the least significant 8 bits of q to 0.
- 2'b10: Shifts q right by 1 bit, replicating the most significant bit.
- 2'b11: Sets the most significant 8 bits of q to the most significant bit of q.

The default case item assigns 'x' to the output q.'}
