The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) as described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. A: Initial state
2. B: Transition from A to B
3. S0: Transition from B to S0
4. S1: Transition from S0 to S1 when `x` is 1
5. S10: Transition from S1 to S10 when `x` is 0
6. G1: Transition from S10 to G1 when `x` is 1
7. G2: Transition from G1 to G2 when `y` is 0
8. P0: Transition from G2 to P0 when `y` is 0
9. P1: Transition from G1 to P1 when `y` is 1, or from G2 to P1 when `y` is 1

The output `f` is assigned to 1 when the state is B, and the output `g` is assigned to 1 when the state is G1, G2, or P1.

The code handles the state transitions based on the input conditions `x` and `y`, and updates the output variables `f` and `g` accordingly.'}
