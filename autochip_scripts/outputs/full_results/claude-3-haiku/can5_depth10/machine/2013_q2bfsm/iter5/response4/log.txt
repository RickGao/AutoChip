The main issues with the original code were:

1. The `f` and `g` outputs were not declared as `reg` type, which is required for assigning values to them in an always block.
2. The `next_state` logic was missing a default case, which has been added to prevent any unspecified state transitions.

With these corrections, the module should now correctly implement the given FSM specification.'}
