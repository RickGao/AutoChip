The issue with the previous implementation was in the else block. The original code was doing a bitwise XOR operation on the bits of `q`, which was incorrect. The correct way to shift the bits of `q` to the right and add a 0 at the end is to use the concatenation operator `{q[510:0], 1'b0}`. This shifts all the bits of `q` to the right by 1 position and adds a 0 at the end.'}
