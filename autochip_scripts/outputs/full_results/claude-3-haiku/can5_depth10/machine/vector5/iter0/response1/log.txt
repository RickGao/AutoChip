```

The original code had a few issues:
1. The input and output port declarations were not aligned correctly.
2. The vector assignments for `a_vec`, `b_vec`, `c_vec`, `d_vec`, and `e_vec` were missing.
3. The final assignment for `out` was missing.

I've corrected these issues in the provided Verilog code. The module now correctly computes the bitwise exclusive-OR of the two 25-bit vectors as per the specification.'}
