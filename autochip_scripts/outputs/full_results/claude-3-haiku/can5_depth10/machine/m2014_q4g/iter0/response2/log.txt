The output is calculated by performing a bitwise XOR operation on in1 and in2, and then performing a bitwise NOT operation on the result, followed by another bitwise XOR operation with in3.

    assign temp = in1 ^ in2;

```

The original module had a few issues:
1. The inputs and output were declared as `input` and `output` without the `logic` keyword, which is required for synthesizable Verilog code.
2. The intermediate signal `temp` was not declared.
3. The module was missing the `endmodule` statement.

The corrected module declares the inputs and output as `logic` types, introduces the `temp` signal, and adds the missing `endmodule` statement.'}
