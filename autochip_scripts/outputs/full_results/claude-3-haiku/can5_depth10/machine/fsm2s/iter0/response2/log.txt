The main changes made are:

1. Declared a register `state` to keep track of the current state (0 for state A, 1 for state B).
2. Added an `always` block that updates the state on the positive edge of the clock, or when the reset signal is high.
3. Added an `always` block that sets the output `out` based on the current state.
4. Initialized the state to 0 (state A) when the reset signal is high.
5. Implemented the state transition logic based on the input signals `j` and `k`.

This Verilog module should now correctly implement the given two-state state machine specification.'}
