The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Added a state register to keep track of the current state of the FSM.
2. Defined the three states: IDLE, SHIFT_ENABLE, and SHIFT_HOLD.
3. In the `reset` condition, the module goes to the SHIFT_ENABLE state and asserts `shift_ena` to 1.
4. In the SHIFT_ENABLE state, the module sets `shift_ena` to 1 and transitions to the SHIFT_HOLD state.
5. In the SHIFT_HOLD state, the module keeps `shift_ena` at 0 until 4 clock cycles have elapsed, then transitions back to the IDLE state.

This ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and remains 0 otherwise until the next reset.'}
