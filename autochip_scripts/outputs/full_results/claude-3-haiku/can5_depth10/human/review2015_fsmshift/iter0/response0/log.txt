The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It implements the required functionality of asserting `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then keeping it de-asserted until the next reset.

The module uses a counter `count` to keep track of the number of cycles to assert `shift_ena`. When the module is reset, the counter is initialized to `CYCLES - 1` (3 in this case) and `shift_ena` is set to 1. On each subsequent clock cycle, the counter is decremented, and `shift_ena` is kept high until the counter reaches 0, at which point `shift_ena` is set to 0.'}
