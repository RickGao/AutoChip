The Verilog code provided implements the next-state logic for the state signals `y[2]` (corresponding to states B and C) and `y[4]` (corresponding to states D, E, and F) based on the given state transition diagram.

The expression for `Y2` is derived as follows:
- State B (represented by `y[2]`) transitions to state C when `w` is 0.
- State C (represented by `y[3]`) transitions to state D when `w` is 0.
- Therefore, the next-state logic for `y[2]` is the logical OR of these two conditions: `(y[1] & ~w) | (y[3] & ~w)`.

The expression for `Y4` is derived as follows:
- State D (represented by `y[4]`) transitions to state F when `w` is 0, and to state A when `w` is 1.
- State E (represented by `y[5]`) transitions to state D when `w` is 1.
- State F (represented by `y[6]`) transitions to state C when `w` is 0, and to state D when `w` is 1.
- Therefore, the next-state logic for `y[4]` is the logical OR of these three conditions: `(y[2] & w) | (y[3] & w) | (y[5] & ~w)`.'}
