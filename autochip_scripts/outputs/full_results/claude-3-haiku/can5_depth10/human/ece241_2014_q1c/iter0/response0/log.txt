The completed Verilog module performs the following:

1. Declares a 9-bit wire `sum` to hold the extended result of the addition.
2. Assigns the sum of `a` and `b` to `sum`, with the MSB of `a` and `b` (the sign bits) extended to the 9th bit.
3. Assigns the lower 8 bits of `sum` to the output `s`.
4. Assigns the overflow flag based on the condition:
   - If the sign bits of `a` and `b` are the same, and the sign bit of the result `sum[7]` is different, then an overflow has occurred.

This logic correctly handles the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects the overflow condition.'}
