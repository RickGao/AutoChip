The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The main issues in the previous code were:

1. The `shift_ena` signal was not being properly controlled in the `WAIT_START` state. It should only be asserted when the start pattern is detected.
2. The transition from `NOTIFY_USER` to `WAIT_ACK` was missing.
3. The `done` signal was not being properly reset after the `ack` signal was received.

These issues have been addressed in the corrected module.'}
