After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine for the timer functionality as described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the start pattern of 1101.
2. `DETECT_PATTERN`: This state detects the 1101 pattern and then transitions to the `COUNT_DURATION` state.
3. `COUNT_DURATION`: This state shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration, asserts the `shift_ena` output, and then transitions to the `NOTIFY_USER` state.
4. `NOTIFY_USER`: This state asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out, and waits for the `ack` input to be asserted before transitioning back to the `IDLE` state.

The module also has a synchronous reset that sets the state back to `IDLE` and clears all the outputs.'}
