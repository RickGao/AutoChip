```

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given circuit specification. The module takes three inputs (`in1`, `in2`, and `in3`) and produces one output (`out`). The logic is implemented as follows:

1. The XNOR operation is performed on `in1` and `in2`, and the result is stored in the internal signal `xnor_out`.
2. The XOR operation is performed between `xnor_out` and `in3`, and the result is assigned to the output `out`.

This module will correctly produce the desired output as per the given circuit specification.'}
