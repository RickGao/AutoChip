{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: This is the initial state where the FSM waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: In this state, the FSM shifts in the 8 data bits, and then transitions to the `DATA` state.
3. `DATA`: In this state, the FSM checks for the stop bit (1). If the stop bit is detected, the `done` signal is set, and the FSM transitions back to the `IDLE` state. If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM transitions to the `ERROR` state.
4. `ERROR`: In this state, the FSM waits for the stop bit (1) to be detected before transitioning back to the `IDLE` state.

The `count` variable is used to keep track of the number of bits received, and the `data_reg` variable is used to store the 8 data bits.

The code also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the FSM is reset to the `IDLE` state, and the `done` signal is cleared when the `reset` input is high.'}
