This Verilog module implements a full adder by performing the following operations:

1. Generating the sum (s1) of the two input bits `a` and `b` using the XOR operation.
2. Generating the carry-out (c1) from the two input bits `a` and `b` using the AND operation.
3. Generating the final sum (sum) by XORing the intermediate sum (s1) with the carry-in (cin).
4. Generating the intermediate carry-out (c2) by ANDing the intermediate sum (s1) with the carry-in (cin).
5. Generating the final carry-out (cout) by ORing the two carry-out signals (c1 and c2).

The module takes three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `cin`) and produces two outputs (`cout` and `sum`) representing the carry-out and the sum of the full adder operation, respectively.'}
