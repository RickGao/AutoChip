{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle.

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a `load` signal, a 512-bit input `data`, and outputs a 512-bit register `q` representing the state of the cellular automaton.
2. In the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal, the module checks if the `load` signal is high.
   - If `load` is high, the module assigns the input `data` to the output `q`.
   - If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton as per the Rule 90 logic:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is assigned the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
     - The last cell `q[511]` is always set to 0 (off), representing the boundary condition.
     - For all the remaining cells, the value of the current cell `q[i]` is assigned the XOR of the values of its two neighboring cells `q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`.

This implementation ensures that the state of the 512-cell cellular automaton is updated correctly according to the Rule 90 logic, and that the boundary conditions are handled appropriately.'}
