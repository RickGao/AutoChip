{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

The corrected Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The `q` register holds the state of the 512-cell system.
2. On a clock edge, if `load` is high, the state is loaded from the `data` input.
3. If `load` is low, the next state of the system is calculated based on the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are set to the values of their single neighbors, since the boundary conditions are assumed to be 0.
   - For all other cells, the next state is the XOR of the current left and right neighbors.

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell system based on the Rule 90 cellular automaton.'}
