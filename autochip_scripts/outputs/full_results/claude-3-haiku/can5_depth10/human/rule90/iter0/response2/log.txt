{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}
{'assistant': 'Here is the completed Verilog module for the Rule 90 cellular automaton:

    always @(posedge clk) begin

            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. Use a loop to compute the next state of each cell, except for the boundary cells.
2. For the boundary cells, set them to 0 as specified in the problem statement.
3. Update the state of the cells on the positive edge of the clock, with the load signal taking priority to load the initial state.

This implementation should correctly simulate the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement.'}
