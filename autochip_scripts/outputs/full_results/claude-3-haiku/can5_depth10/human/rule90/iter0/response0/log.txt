{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes four inputs: `clk` (clock), `load` (load signal), `data` (initial state of the 512-cell system), and `q` (the current state of the 512-cell system).
2. Inside the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock, the code checks if the `load` signal is active.
   - If `load` is active, the current state `q` is updated with the new `data`.
   - If `load` is not active, the code updates the state of the 512-cell system as per the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]` (the left boundary is assumed to be zero).
     - The last cell `q[511]` is always set to zero (the right boundary is assumed to be zero).
     - For the remaining cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the new state is calculated as the XOR of the current cell and its two neighbors.

This implementation correctly advances the state of the 512-cell system by one time step on each clock cycle, as per the given Rule 90 cellular automaton rules.'}
