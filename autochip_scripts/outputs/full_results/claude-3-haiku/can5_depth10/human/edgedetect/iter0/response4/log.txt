The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The module has a input signal `in` of width 8 bits, a clock input `clk`, and an output signal `pedge` of width 8 bits.
2. The module uses a register `in_d1` to store the previous value of the `in` signal.
3. In the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, the module performs the following operations:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_d1`, effectively storing the previous value.
   - Computes the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the current value of `in` and the inverted previous value `~in_d1`. This will result in a 1 in the `pedge` output only for the bits where the input signal has transitioned from 0 to 1.
   - Assigns the positive edge detection result to the `pedge` output.

This module correctly implements the given specification and should compile and function as expected.'}
