The population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector can be implemented as follows:

1. The circuit uses a wire `count` to store the 2-bit result.
2. The least significant bit `count[0]` is assigned the XOR of the 3 input bits, which gives the count of the number of '1's in the input vector.
3. The most significant bit `count[1]` is assigned the OR of the three AND combinations of the input bits, which indicates if there are 2 or 3 '1's in the input vector.
4. The output `out` is assigned the `count` wire.

This circuit correctly implements the population count logic for a 3-bit input vector.'}
