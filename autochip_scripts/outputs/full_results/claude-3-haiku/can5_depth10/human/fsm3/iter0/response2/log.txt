The provided Verilog module implements the specified Moore state machine with a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The module has the following components:

1. `state` and `next_state` registers to store the current and next state of the FSM.
2. Localparam definitions for the four states: A, B, C, and D.
3. Combinational logic for the state transition logic, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `in`.
4. Combinational logic for the output logic, which sets the output `out` based on the current state.
5. Sequential logic for the state register, which updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock, and resets the state to A when the asynchronous reset `areset` is high.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified state machine and should compile without any errors.'}
