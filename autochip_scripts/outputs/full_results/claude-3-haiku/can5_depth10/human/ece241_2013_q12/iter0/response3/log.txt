{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided Verilog code defines a module called `top_module` that implements an 8x1 memory using an 8-bit shift register and a multiplexer. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `enable`: The enable signal that controls whether the shift register should shift or not.
- `S`: The input bit to be shifted into the shift register.
- `A`, `B`, `C`: Three input signals that select which bit of the shift register should be output.
- `Z`: The output signal, which is the selected bit from the shift register.

The module has the following functionality:

1. The 8-bit shift register is implemented using a `reg [7:0] Q` variable, which is updated on the positive edge of the clock when the `enable` signal is high. The shift register shifts in the input bit `S` from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
2. The combinational logic for the output `Z` is implemented using a `case` statement that selects the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. If the input combination of `A`, `B`, and `C` is not valid (i.e., not one of the 8 combinations), the output `Z` is set to `1'bx` (a don't-care value).

This module can be used to realize a 3-input logic function by selecting the appropriate bit from the 8-bit shift register based on the input combination of `A`, `B`, and `C`.'}
