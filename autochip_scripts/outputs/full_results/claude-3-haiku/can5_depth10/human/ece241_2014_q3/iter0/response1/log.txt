The code above implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and two 2-to-1 multiplexers. The inputs `c` and `d` are used to generate the four outputs `out1`, `out2`, `out3`, and `out4`, which are then connected to the inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

The logic expressions for the four outputs are:
- `out1 = c`
- `out2 = 0`
- `out3 = c | d`
- `out4 = c | d`

This implementation uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers required to implement the Karnaugh map.'}
