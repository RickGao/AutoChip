The provided Verilog module "top_module" implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and three 2-to-1 multiplexers. The module takes inputs `c` and `d`, and generates the four outputs `mux_in[3:0]` that can be connected to the inputs of a 4-to-1 multiplexer.

The key steps are:
1. Implement the Karnaugh map using three 2-to-1 multiplexers, with the expressions `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.
2. Connect the outputs of the 2-to-1 multiplexers to the corresponding inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer, i.e., `mux_in[0]` to `x1`, `mux_in[1]` to `x2`, `mux_in[2]` to `x3`, and `mux_in[3]` to the remaining expression `(~c & ~d)`.

This implementation uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers (3) required to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
