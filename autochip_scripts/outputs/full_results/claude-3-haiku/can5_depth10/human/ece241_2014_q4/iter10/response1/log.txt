module top_module (

assign z = (q1 ^ q2 ^ q3);

endmodule

The main issues in the previous implementation were:

1. The flip-flop inputs were not correctly assigned. The second input of the XOR gate should be the complement of the corresponding flip-flop output, not the output itself.
2. The output assignment for the XNOR gate was incorrect. It should be an XOR, not an XNOR.

With these corrections, the module should now work correctly with the provided testbench.'}
