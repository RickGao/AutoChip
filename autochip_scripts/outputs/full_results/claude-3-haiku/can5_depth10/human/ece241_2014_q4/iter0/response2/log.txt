This Verilog module implements the given finite state machine circuit. The key elements are:

1. Declared the three D flip-flops `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the intermediate states.
2. Implemented the combinational logic for the XOR, AND, and OR gates, using the current inputs `x` and the flip-flop outputs.
3. Computed the final output `z` using the XNOR of the three gate outputs.
4. Updated the flip-flop values in the always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

The initial reset state of the flip-flops is not explicitly set, but the problem statement assumes they are initially reset to zero before the machine begins.'}
