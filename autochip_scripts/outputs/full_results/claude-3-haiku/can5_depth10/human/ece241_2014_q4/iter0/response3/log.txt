The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It consists of a top-level `top_module` that instantiates three D flip-flops and the necessary logic gates to implement the desired functionality.

The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop that updates its `q` and `q_bar` (complementary) outputs on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

The `top_module` instantiates the three D flip-flops and connects the logic gates as specified in the problem statement. The `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` signals are the inputs to the respective D flip-flops, and the `z` output is the result of the three-input XNOR gate.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
