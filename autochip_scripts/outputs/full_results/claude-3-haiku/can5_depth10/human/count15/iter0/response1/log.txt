The corrected Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The counter is implemented using a single `always` block that runs on the positive edge of the clock signal.
2. Inside the `always` block, the counter value `q` is updated based on the following logic:
   - If the reset input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches the maximum value of 15 (binary 1111), it is reset to 0 on the next clock cycle.
3. The counter value is stored in the output register `q` using the `reg` data type.

This implementation correctly captures the desired behavior of the 4-bit binary counter with a synchronous reset.'}
