The provided Verilog module specification is a correct implementation of a Mealy machine that performs 2's complementer functionality using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module takes in three inputs: `clk`, `areset`, and `x`.
2. The module has one output: `z`.
3. The module uses one-hot encoding for the states, with `A` represented as `2'b01` and `B` represented as `2'b10`.
4. The `next_state` logic is implemented in the first `always` block, which determines the next state and output `z` based on the current state and input `x`.
5. The `state` update logic is implemented in the second `always` block, which updates the state register on the positive edge of `clk` or when `areset` is high.
6. The module resets into state `A` when `areset` is high.

This implementation is correct and should compile without any issues.'}
