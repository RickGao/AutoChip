The Verilog module provided here is a complete implementation of the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The module uses two-bit one-hot encoding for the state, with states `A` and `B` represented by `2'b01` and `2'b10`, respectively.
3. The state transitions are defined in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The output `z` is also determined in the `always @(*)` block, based on the current state and the input `x`.
5. The module resets asynchronously to state `A` when `areset` is high.

This Verilog module correctly implements the given Mealy machine specification.'}
