The Verilog module provided implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. It has an asynchronous active-high reset signal `areset` that resets the state to `A`.
2. The current state is stored in the `state` register, and the next state is calculated in the `next_state` register.
3. The output `z` is calculated based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The state transitions are defined in the always block that handles the state updates.

The module correctly implements the given state diagram and logic.'}
