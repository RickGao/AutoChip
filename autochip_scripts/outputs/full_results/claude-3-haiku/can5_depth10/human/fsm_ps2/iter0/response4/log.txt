{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `in[7:0]` for the input byte stream, an input `reset` for the reset signal, and an output `done` to signal the completion of a message.
2. The module uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state of the finite state machine.
3. The finite state machine has three states:
   - `WAIT_FOR_FIRST_BYTE`: In this state, the module waits for the first byte of a message, which is indicated by `in[3]` being 1.
   - `WAIT_FOR_SECOND_BYTE`: Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to this state to wait for the second byte of the message.
   - `WAIT_FOR_THIRD_BYTE`: Once the second byte is received, the module transitions to this state to wait for the third byte of the message.
4. The `done` output is set to 1 in the cycle immediately after the third byte of the message is received, and is reset to 0 in all other cases.
5. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `WAIT_FOR_FIRST_BYTE` and `done` to 0.'}
