This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and one triggered on the negative edge. The output `q` is then driven by a combinational logic block that selects between the two flip-flop outputs based on the current state of the clock signal.

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. The use of two separate flip-flops, `q_posedge` and `q_negedge`, to capture the input data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The use of an `always` block with a level-sensitive sensitivity list (`@(*)`) to drive the output `q` based on the current state of the clock signal.

This approach ensures that the module behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not have native support for such a construct.'}
