The provided Verilog module is a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, despite the fact that FPGAs do not have native support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `d_dly` register is used to store the previous value of the `d` input.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
3. Inside the `always` block, the `d_dly` register is updated with the current value of `d`.
4. The output `q` is assigned the exclusive-OR (`^`) of the current `d` value and the delayed `d_dly` value.

This way, the output `q` will toggle on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
