This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate registers `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`, respectively. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current value of `clk` using a combinational logic block.'}
