```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two D-type flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge.
2. Combine the outputs of the two flip-flops using a logical OR operation to create the final output `q`, which exhibits the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

This approach works around the limitation that FPGAs do not have native dual-edge triggered flip-flops, by using two separate flip-flops triggered on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.'}
