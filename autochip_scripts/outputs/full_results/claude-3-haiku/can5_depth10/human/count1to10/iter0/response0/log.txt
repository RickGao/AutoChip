The completed Verilog module for the given specification is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` takes two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset`, and one output `q` which is a 4-bit register.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, the counter `q` is reset to `1`.
4. If `reset` is not high, the module checks if the current value of `q` is equal to `10`. If it is, the counter is reset to `1`.
5. If the current value of `q` is not `10`, the module increments the counter by `1`.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from `1` to `10` inclusive, and resets to `1` when the `reset` input is high.'}
