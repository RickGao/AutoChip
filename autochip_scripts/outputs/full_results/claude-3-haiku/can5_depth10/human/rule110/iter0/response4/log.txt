{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. The `top_module` takes in a clock signal `clk`, a synchronous active high load input `load`, and a 512-bit input `data` that represents the initial state of the cells. The output `q` is a 512-bit register that holds the current state of the cells.

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. If the `load` input is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new state `data`. If the `load` input is low, the module advances the state of the cells by one time step according to the Rule 110 logic.

The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on the values of the two boundary cells `q[511]` and `q[510]`, and the remaining cells `q[1]` to `q[511]` are updated based on their own value and the values of their left and right neighbors.'}
