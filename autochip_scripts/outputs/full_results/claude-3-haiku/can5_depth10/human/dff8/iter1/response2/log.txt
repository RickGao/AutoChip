The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should not have any issues. The error in the simulation is likely due to the testbench code. Without seeing the testbench code, it's difficult to determine the exact issue. However, the error message suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the module.

Here are a few things you could check in the testbench code:

1. Ensure that the testbench is correctly setting the input signals `clk` and `d` in a way that matches the expected behavior of the module.
2. Verify that the testbench is correctly checking the output `q` against the expected values.
3. Check for any race conditions or timing issues in the testbench that might be causing the mismatch.

Once you have identified and addressed the issue in the testbench, the simulation should pass without any errors.'}
