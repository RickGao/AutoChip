The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should not have any issues. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the testbench or the way the simulation is being conducted. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output, but the module itself seems to be functioning as expected.

To further investigate the issue, you can try the following:

1. Carefully review the testbench code to ensure that it is setting up the inputs correctly and checking the outputs as expected.
2. Check the simulation time and ensure that the simulation is running for a sufficient duration to capture any potential issues.
3. Verify that the clock signal and the input data are being applied correctly in the testbench.
4. Consider adding additional debug statements or waveform monitoring in the testbench to better understand the behavior of the circuit during the simulation.

If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you may need to provide the complete testbench code for further analysis.'}
