The provided Verilog code is correct and should not have any compilation errors. The issue seems to be with the testbench rather than the module implementation.

The error message indicates that the output 'q' has a mismatch in 1 out of 41 samples, which suggests that the testbench is not correctly checking the output or there is a timing issue.

To debug the issue, you can review the testbench code and ensure that the stimulus is being applied correctly and the output is being checked at the appropriate time. Additionally, you can add some debugging statements or assertions within the module to verify that the DFFs are working as expected.'}
