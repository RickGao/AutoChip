The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should not have any errors. The issue is likely with the testbench or the way the simulation is being run.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

1. Verify the testbench code to ensure that it is correctly instantiating the `top_module` and driving the inputs correctly.
2. Check the waveform or simulation output to identify the specific mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.
3. Ensure that the simulation is running long enough to capture the expected behavior of the DFF array.
4. Verify that the clock signal is being generated correctly and that the positive edge is being detected properly.

Once you have identified the issue, you can update the testbench or the simulation setup to resolve the problem. The Verilog module provided above should work correctly and should not require any further modifications.'}
