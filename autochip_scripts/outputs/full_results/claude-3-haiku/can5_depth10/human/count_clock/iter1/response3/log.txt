The main issues in the original module were:

1. The initial values for `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` were not in the correct BCD format. They should be `8'd12`, `8'd0`, and `8'd0` respectively.
2. The increment logic for `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` was not correct. The corrected logic is shown in the updated module.

With these changes, the module should now pass the testbench.'}
