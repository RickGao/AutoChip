{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0].

For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left.

The changes made are:
1. For `out_both`, the loop now runs from 0 to 98 since `out_both[98]` is not needed.
2. For `out_any`, the condition in the second part of the ternary operator is changed to `(i > 0)` instead of `((i > 0) ? in[i-1] : 1'b0)` to handle the case when `i` is 0.
3. No other changes are needed.'}
