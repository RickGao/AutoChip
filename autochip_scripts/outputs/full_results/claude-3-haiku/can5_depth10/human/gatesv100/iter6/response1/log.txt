{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0].

For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'.

Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left.

endmodule

The main changes are:
1. In the first `generate` loop for `out_both`, the upper bound is changed to 98 since `out_both[98]` does not need to be calculated.
2. `out_both[98]` is explicitly assigned to 1'b0, since `in[99]` has no neighbour to the left.
3. The `out_any` port width is changed to 100 bits to match the specification.

These changes should resolve the compilation warnings.'}
