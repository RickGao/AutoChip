Explanation of the code:

1. The module has four ports: `clk` (positive edge-triggered clock), `areset` (asynchronous reset), `x` (input bit), and `z` (output bit).
2. It uses two 8-bit registers: `count` to keep track of the number of bits processed, and `complement` to store the 2's complement of the input.
3. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset signal.
4. When `areset` is high, the module resets the `count`, `complement`, and `z` to 0.
5. When `areset` is low, the module checks if `count` is less than 8 (i.e., the input number is less than 8 bits).
   - If `count` is less than 8, the module increments `count`, shifts `complement` right by 1 bit, sets the most significant bit of `complement` to the current input bit `x`, and assigns the negation of the least significant bit of `complement` to the output `z`.
   - If `count` is 8 or more, the module resets `count` and `complement` to 0, and sets `z` to 0.

This implementation ensures that the 2's complement of the input number is calculated and provided as the output `z` for each bit of the input, one bit per clock cycle, until the entire input number has been processed.'}
