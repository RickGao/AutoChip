```

The key changes are:

1. Removed the previous logic and replaced it with a state machine implementation.
2. The state machine has 9 states (S0 to S8) to handle the 2's complement conversion.
3. The output `z` is updated based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The state transitions are handled in the `case` statement based on the current state and the input `x`.

This implementation should now correctly generate the 2's complement of the input bits.'}
