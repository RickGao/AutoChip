The main issues in the previous module were:

1. The `z` output was not initialized correctly. It should be initialized to 0 when `areset` is asserted.
2. The `complement` register was not initialized correctly. It should be initialized to 0 when `areset` is asserted.

These changes should fix the errors reported in the simulation and pass the testbench.'}
