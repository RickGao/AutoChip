The main issues with the previous version were:

1. The `complement` register was only 8 bits wide, which was not sufficient to store the 2's complement of an 8-bit number. It needed to be 9 bits wide.

2. The shifting and masking logic to construct the 2's complement was incorrect. The previous code was shifting the `complement` register to the right by 1 bit and ORing with `x << 7`, which was not the correct way to build the 2's complement.

In the corrected version:

1. The `complement` register is 9 bits wide to accommodate the 2's complement of an 8-bit number.

2. The shifting and masking logic to construct the 2's complement is corrected. The input `x` is shifted left by 8 bits and ORed with the right-shifted `complement` register to build the 2's complement correctly.

This should resolve the issues reported in the simulation output and pass the testbench.'}
