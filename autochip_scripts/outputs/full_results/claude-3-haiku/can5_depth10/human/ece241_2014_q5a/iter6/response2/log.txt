    output reg z

    end
end

endmodule

The main issue was that the output 'z' was being assigned the incorrect value. The corrected module now assigns the correct 2's complement value to the output 'z' based on the state of the 'complement' register.

The changes are:
1. Inside the 'else' block, when 'count < 8', the output 'z' is assigned the negated value of the least-significant bit of the 'complement' register.
2. Inside the 'else if' block, when 'count == 8', the output 'z' is assigned the least-significant bit of the 'complement' register, which now holds the final 2's complement value.

This should fix the issues reported by the testbench.'}
