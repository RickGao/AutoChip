The main issue with the original module was that the output `z` was not being updated correctly. In the original module, `z` was being assigned the inverted least-significant bit of the `complement` register, which is not the correct 2's complement of the input.

In the corrected module, the assignment of `z` has been updated. When `count` is less than 8, `z` is assigned the inverted least-significant bit of the `complement` register, which gives the correct 2's complement output. When `count` is equal to 8, `z` is assigned the least-significant bit of the 2's complemented `complement` register, which is the final 2's complement output.

This should fix the issues observed in the testbench simulation.'}
