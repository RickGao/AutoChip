This Verilog module implements a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, and asserts a `tc` (terminal count) signal when the countdown reaches zero.

The key features of the implementation are:

1. The module has a 10-bit `counter` register to store the current countdown value.
2. In the always block, the module checks for the `load` signal:
   - If `load` is 1, the module loads the `data` input into the `counter` register and clears the `tc` output.
   - If `load` is 0, the module decrements the `counter` register by 1 on each clock cycle.
3. The `tc` output is set to 1 when the `counter` reaches 1, indicating that the countdown has reached zero. Once the countdown reaches zero, the `tc` output remains 1 until the next `load` event.

This implementation should correctly handle the timer functionality as specified in the problem description.'}
