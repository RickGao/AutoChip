The main changes are:

1. Declared `tc` as a `reg` output, as it is assigned a value in the always block.
2. In the `else if` block, the decrement of `counter` was changed to `counter <= counter - 1'b1;` to properly decrement the counter.
3. The comparison of `counter` to 1 was changed to `(counter == 1'b1)` to ensure a single-bit comparison.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the testbench simulation.'}
