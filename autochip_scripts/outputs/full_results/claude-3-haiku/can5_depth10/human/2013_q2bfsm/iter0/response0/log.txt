{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. It has the following features:

1. The module has four states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.
2. The `resetn` input is used to reset the module to the `STATE_A` when it is low.
3. The `f` output is set to 1 for one clock cycle when the FSM transitions from `STATE_A` to `STATE_B`.
4. The `x_count` variable is used to keep track of the sequence of `x` inputs (1, 0, 1).
5. When the `x_count` reaches 2, the FSM transitions to `STATE_C` and sets the `g` output to 1.
6. In `STATE_C`, the FSM monitors the `y` input. If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, the `g` output is maintained at 1 permanently (until reset). If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, the `g` output is set to 0 permanently (until reset).
7. The `next_state` logic is implemented in the always block that is sensitive to the `*` (all inputs).'}
