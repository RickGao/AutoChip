{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings state machine as per the given specification. The module has the following features:

1. It uses a single-bit state register `state` to track the current state of the Lemming (walking left or walking right).
2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` and the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.
3. When `areset` is high, the state is set to `LEFT`, `walk_left` is set to 1, and `walk_right` is set to 0, resetting the Lemming to walk left.
4. In the `LEFT` state, the Lemming walks left (`walk_left = 1` and `walk_right = 0`). If `bump_right` is high, the state transitions to `RIGHT`.
5. In the `RIGHT` state, the Lemming walks right (`walk_left = 0` and `walk_right = 1`). If `bump_left` is high, the state transitions to `LEFT`.
6. The default case ensures that if the state is in an unknown state, it is reset to `LEFT`.

This Verilog module correctly models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
