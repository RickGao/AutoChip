The module has three states:
1. **State A**: This is the reset state. The FSM remains in this state as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it moves to State B.
2. **State B**: In this state, the FSM checks the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. It keeps track of the number of times `w = 1` using the `w_count` variable. If `w = 1` in exactly two of these clock cycles, it moves to State C in the next clock cycle.
3. **State C**: In this state, the output `z` is set to 1 for the next clock cycle, and then the FSM moves back to State B to continue checking the input `w`.

The module uses a `next_state` register to keep track of the next state based on the current state and the input `s` and `w`. The `w_count` register is used to keep track of the number of times `w = 1` in the three clock cycles. The output `z` is set to 1 in State C and 0 otherwise.'}
