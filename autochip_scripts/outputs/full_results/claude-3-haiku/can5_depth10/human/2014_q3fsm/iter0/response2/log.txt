The Verilog module provided implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has four inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `s`, and `w`, and one output: `z`.

The module uses three states: `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial state is `A`, which represents the reset state. The module remains in state `A` as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to state `B`.

In state `B`, the module examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the module sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

The module uses a counter (`count`) to keep track of the number of clock cycles in state `B`. When the counter reaches 3, the module transitions back to state `A`.

The `next_state` logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input values.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the module's state and output based on the current state, input values, and the reset signal.'}
