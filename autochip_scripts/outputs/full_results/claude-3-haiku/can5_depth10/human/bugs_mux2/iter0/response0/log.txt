```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,

    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin

```

The issue in the original code was that the `assign` statement was performing a bitwise AND operation on the `sel` signal and the `a` or `b` input, which is not the intended behavior for a 2-to-1 multiplexer. Instead, the correct way to implement a multiplexer is to use a conditional statement (either an `if-else` or a `case` statement) to select between the two inputs based on the `sel` signal.

In the corrected module, the `always` block with the `@(*)` sensitivity list ensures that the `out` output is updated whenever any of the input signals change. The `if-else` statement inside the `always` block selects between the `a` and `b` inputs based on the value of the `sel` signal, and assigns the selected value to the `out` output.'}
