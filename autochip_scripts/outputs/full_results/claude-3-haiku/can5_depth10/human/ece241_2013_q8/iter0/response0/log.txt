This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has an asynchronous negative edge-triggered reset and consists of 3 states: `IDLE`, `S1`, and `S2`.

The state transitions and output logic are as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, if `x` is 1, the state transitions to `S1`, otherwise, it remains in the `IDLE` state. The output `z` is always 0 in the `IDLE` state.
2. In the `S1` state, if `x` is 0, the state transitions to `S2`, otherwise, it remains in the `S1` state. The output `z` is always 0 in the `S1` state.
3. In the `S2` state, if `x` is 1, the state transitions to `S3` and the output `z` is asserted to 1. If `x` is 0, the state transitions back to the `IDLE` state, and the output `z` is 0.
4. In the `S3` state, if `x` is 0, the state transitions back to the `IDLE` state, and the output `z` is 0. If `x` is 1, the state transitions to `S1`, and the output `z` is 0.

This FSM is designed to recognize overlapping sequences of "101", ensuring that the output `z` is asserted correctly.'}
