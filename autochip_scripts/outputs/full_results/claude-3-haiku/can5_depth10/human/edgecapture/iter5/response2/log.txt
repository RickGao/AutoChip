end

endmodule

The issues in the previous module were:
1. The condition for setting the output bit was `in[i] & ~out[i]`, which would only capture the transition from 0 to 1. The correct condition is `in[i] && !out[i]` to capture the transition from 1 to 0.
2. The condition for resetting the output bit was `~in[i]`, which would reset the output bit on any transition, including 1 to 1 or 0 to 0. The correct condition is `!in[i]` to only reset the output bit when the input transitions from 1 to 0.

With these corrections, the module should now pass the testbench.'}
