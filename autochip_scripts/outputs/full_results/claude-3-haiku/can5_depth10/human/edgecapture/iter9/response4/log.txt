The main issues with the previous code were:

1. The comparison operator in the first `if` statement was using the logical AND (`&&`) instead of the bitwise AND (`&`). This caused the output to not be set correctly when the input bit changed from 1 to 0.

2. The `else if` condition was checking for `~in[i]` instead of `~in[i] & out[i]`. This caused the output to be cleared even when the input bit did not change from 1 to 0.

The corrected code should now properly capture the change from 1 to 0 for each bit in the 32-bit input vector.'}
