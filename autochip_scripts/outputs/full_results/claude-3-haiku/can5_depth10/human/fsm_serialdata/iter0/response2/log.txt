{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can correctly receive a byte of serial data with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module handles the case where the stop bit is not detected on time and waits for the next stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The main components of the module are:

1. `state`: A 3-bit state variable that represents the current state of the FSM (`IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, `STOP`).
2. `bit_count`: A 4-bit variable that keeps track of the number of bits received in the current byte.
3. `data_reg`: An 8-bit register that stores the received data bits.
4. `out_byte`: An 8-bit output that holds the correctly received data byte.
5. `done`: A 1-bit output that indicates when a complete byte has been received.

The FSM operates as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, it waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. Once the start bit is detected, it transitions to the `START` state and starts receiving the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg`.
3. After the 8 data bits have been received, it checks for the stop bit (1). If the stop bit is detected, it transitions to the `STOP` state, sets the `out_byte` output, and asserts the `done` signal. If the stop bit is not detected, it returns to the `IDLE` state.
4. In the `STOP` state, it waits for the stop bit to be verified before returning to the `IDLE` state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality that resets the state, bit count, data register, and output signals when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
