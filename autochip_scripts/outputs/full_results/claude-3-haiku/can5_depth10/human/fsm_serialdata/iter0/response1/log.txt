{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements the specified finite state machine behavior. It has the following key features:

1. The module has three states: `IDLE`, `RECEIVE_DATA`, and `WAIT_FOR_STOP_BIT`.
2. In the `IDLE` state, it waits for the start bit (0) to begin receiving a new byte.
3. In the `RECEIVE_DATA` state, it shifts in the 8 data bits, one at a time, into the `data_reg` register.
4. After receiving the 8 data bits, it checks for the stop bit (1). If the stop bit is detected, it sets the `out_byte` output and asserts the `done` signal.
5. If the stop bit is not detected when expected, it transitions to the `WAIT_FOR_STOP_BIT` state to wait for the stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
6. The module includes a synchronous reset functionality that resets all the state variables and outputs.
7. The module assumes that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, as specified in the problem statement.'}
