The provided Verilog module `top_module` represents a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. It includes the necessary inputs and output to implement the functionality described in the problem statement.

The module has the following inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting the register.
- `L`: The signal to load the register.

The module has the following output:
- `Q`: The output of the stage.

The behavior of the module is as follows:
1. If the `L` signal is asserted, the register is loaded with the value of `R`.
2. If the `E` signal is asserted, the register is shifted by one stage, taking the value of `w` as the new input.
3. If neither `L` nor `E` are asserted, the register maintains its current value.

The Verilog code correctly implements the described functionality using a single `always` block that handles the two cases (load and shift) based on the input signals.'}
