{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

The issue with the previous module was that the initial value of `q` was not set correctly. The maximum-length LFSR should start from the state `00001`, as per the problem statement. The corrected module initializes `q` to `00001` when the `reset` input is high.'}
