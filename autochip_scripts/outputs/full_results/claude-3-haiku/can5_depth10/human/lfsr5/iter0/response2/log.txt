The provided module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset the LFSR output to 1.

The implemented module has the following features:

1. The current state of the LFSR is stored in the `q` register.
2. The `next_q` register is used to compute the next state of the LFSR.
3. On the positive edge of the `clk` signal, the `q` register is updated with the value of `next_q`, unless the `reset` signal is active, in which case the LFSR is reset to `5'b00001`.
4. The `next_q` value is computed by XORing the current value of `q[0]` (the output bit) with `q[2]` (the tap at bit position 3), and then shifting the remaining bits to the right by one position.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through all possible 2^5-1 = 31 non-zero states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
