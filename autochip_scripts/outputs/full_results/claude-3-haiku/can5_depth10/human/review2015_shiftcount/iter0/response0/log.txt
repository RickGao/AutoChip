This Verilog module implements a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The `q` register is a 4-bit output that holds the current state of the shift register/counter.

The `always` block listens for the positive edge of the `clk` signal and performs the following actions:

1. If `shift_ena` is `1`, the new data bit is shifted into the most significant bit of the `q` register, and the remaining bits are shifted one position to the right.
2. If `count_ena` is `1`, the value in the `q` register is decremented by 1.

The behavior when both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are `1` is not specified, as the problem statement mentions that it does not matter which case gets higher priority.'}
