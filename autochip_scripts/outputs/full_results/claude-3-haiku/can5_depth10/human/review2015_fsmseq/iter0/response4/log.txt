The provided Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and keeps it at 1 until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module uses four states (S0, S1, S2, S3) to keep track of the current position in the search sequence. The state transitions are based on the input `data` signal and the current state. When the sequence 1101 is detected, the module transitions to the S3 state and sets `start_shifting` to 1.

The module also handles the reset functionality. When the `reset` input is high, the module resets the state to S0 and sets `start_shifting` to 0.'}
