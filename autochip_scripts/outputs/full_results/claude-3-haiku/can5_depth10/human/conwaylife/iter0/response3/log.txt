{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state. Active high synchronous.\n// (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.\n// The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [255:0] data,\n\toutput reg [255:0] q);'}

```

The main changes are:

1. Added a helper function `count_neighbors` to calculate the number of living neighbors for a given cell.
2. Implemented the main logic in the `always` block, where it iterates over all 256 cells and updates the state based on the rules of the Game of Life.
3. Handled the toroidal (wraparound) behavior by using the modulo operator `%` to calculate the correct neighboring cell indices.

This module should now correctly implement the Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
