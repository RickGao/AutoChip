```

The issue with the previous implementation was that the state transitions were not defined correctly. The corrected module uses the one-hot encoding as specified in the problem statement and implements the state transitions as per the given state transition table.

The key changes are:
1. In the `case` statement, the state conditions are defined using the one-hot encoding as `4'b0001`, `4'b0010`, `4'b0100`, and `4'b1000` for states A, B, C, and D respectively.
2. The `next_state` assignments are updated based on the state transition table.
3. The `out` assignment is correctly implemented to output 1 in state D and 0 in all other states.

This corrected module should pass the provided testbench.'}
