system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module takes three inputs, in1, in2, and in3, and produces a single output, out. The output is calculated by performing a bitwise XOR operation on in1 and in2, and then performing a bitwise NOT operation on the result, followed by another bitwise XOR operation with in3. In other words, the output is equal to (NOT (in1 XOR in2)) XOR in3.
