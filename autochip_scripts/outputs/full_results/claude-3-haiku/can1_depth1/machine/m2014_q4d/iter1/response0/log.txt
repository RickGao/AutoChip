module top_module (

The issue with the original code was that the output `out` was not initialized to a specific value. This meant that the initial value of `out` was unknown, which could lead to incorrect behavior during simulation.

By adding the initial value of `out` to `0` in the `always_ff` block, the output is now initialized correctly and the module should now work as expected.'}
