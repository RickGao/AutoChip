The corrected Verilog module implements the given finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:

1. State A: This is the reset state. The FSM remains in this state as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, the FSM transitions to state B.
2. State B: In this state, the FSM examines the value of the input `w` in the next three clock cycles. It keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w = 1` using the `w_count` register.
3. State C: If the `w_count` register reaches 2 (indicating that `w = 1` in exactly two of the last three clock cycles), the FSM transitions to this state and sets the output `z` to 1 in the next clock cycle.

The `next_state` logic is handled in the always block that uses the current state and the input values to determine the next state. The `w_count` register is updated in the second always block, which keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w = 1` in state B.'}
