The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The main issues with the previous code were:

1. The output `z` was not being properly set in the `A` and `B` states. It has been added to the `case` statement.
2. The `w_count` was not being properly updated in the `B` state. The code has been updated to correctly shift the `w_count` and add the new `w` value.

With these changes, the module should now pass the testbench without any errors.'}
