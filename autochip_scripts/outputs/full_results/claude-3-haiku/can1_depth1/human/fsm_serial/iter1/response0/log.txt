{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The main changes are:

1. In the `IDLE` state, the `bit_count` is initialized to 1 instead of 0 when transitioning to the `START_BIT` state. This is because the first bit received should be the start bit.
2. In the `DATA_BITS` state, the `bit_count` is incremented to 8 instead of 9, as the Verilog code should be storing the 8 data bits.
3. In the `STOP_BIT` state, the `bit_count` is initialized to 1 instead of 0 when transitioning back to the `IDLE` state. This ensures that the next start bit is properly detected.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the test bench simulation.'}
