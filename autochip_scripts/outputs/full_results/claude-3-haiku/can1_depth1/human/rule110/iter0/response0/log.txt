{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects are:

1. The module has a 512-bit output `q` to represent the 512 cells in the system.
2. The `load` input signal is used to load the initial state of the system from the `data` input.
3. On each clock cycle, the module updates the state of the system according to the Rule 110 transition rules. The boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512]) are assumed to be 0.
4. The updated state is stored back into the `q` output register.

The logic for updating the state of each cell is implemented using a `for` loop that iterates over the internal cells (1 to 510) and applies the Rule 110 transition rules. The boundary cells (0 and 511) are updated using the values of the neighboring cells.'}
