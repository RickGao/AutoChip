{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

{'assistant': 'It appears the issue is with the logic in the `STATE_WAIT_THIRD` state. The `done` signal should be asserted only for one cycle, and then the state machine should transition back to the `STATE_WAIT_FIRST` state. Here is the corrected module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,
    output reg done
);

localparam STATE_WAIT_FIRST = 2'd0;
localparam STATE_WAIT_SECOND = 2'd1;
localparam STATE_WAIT_THIRD = 2'd2;

reg [1:0] state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= STATE_WAIT_FIRST;
        done <= 0;
    end else begin
        case (state)
            STATE_WAIT_FIRST: begin
                if (in[3]) begin
                    state <= STATE_WAIT_SECOND;
                end
            end
            STATE_WAIT_SECOND: begin
                state <= STATE_WAIT_THIRD;
            end
            STATE_WAIT_THIRD: begin
                done <= 1;
                state <= STATE_WAIT_FIRST;
            end
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

The main changes are:

1. In the `STATE_WAIT_THIRD` state, the `done` signal is now set to `1` instead of being assigned the value of `1`.
2. After setting `done` to `1`, the state machine transitions back to the `STATE_WAIT_FIRST` state.

This should fix the issue and pass the testbench.'}
