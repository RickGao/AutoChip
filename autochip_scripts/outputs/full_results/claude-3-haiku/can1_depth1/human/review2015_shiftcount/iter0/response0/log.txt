The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has the following ports:
   - `clk`: Clock input
   - `shift_ena`: Shift enable input
   - `count_ena`: Count enable input
   - `data`: Data input
   - `q`: 4-bit output register

2. The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`).

3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the value of the `shift_ena` input:
   - If `shift_ena` is 1, the 4-bit register `q` is updated by shifting the input `data` into the most significant bit, and the rest of the bits are shifted one position to the right.

4. If `shift_ena` is 0, the module checks the value of the `count_ena` input:
   - If `count_ena` is 1, the 4-bit register `q` is decremented by 1.

5. Since the specification states that the full system does not use `shift_ena` and `count_ena` together, the module does not need to handle the case where both control inputs are 1.

This implementation satisfies the given Verilog module specification.'}
