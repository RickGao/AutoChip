The corrected Verilog module detects the positive edge of each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in` and sets the corresponding bit in the output vector `pedge` the cycle after the transition occurs.

The key steps are:

1. Use a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of `in`.
2. On each positive edge of the clock `clk`, update `in_prev` with the current value of `in`.
3. Compute the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the current `in` and the negated previous `in_prev`. This will result in a 1 only at the bits where the transition from 0 to 1 occurred.
4. Assign the positive edge detection result to the output `pedge` register.

This implementation ensures that the output `pedge` is updated one cycle after the positive edge transition occurs in the input `in`.'}
