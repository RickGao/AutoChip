```

The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `shut_off_computer` output was missing the `reg` declaration, which has been added.
2. The `!` operator was missing in the `if (~arrived)` condition, which has been corrected to `if (!arrived)`.
3. The `keep_driving` output was not being properly assigned when `arrived` is true, which has been added as `keep_driving = 0;`.

The corrected module should now compile and function as intended.'}
