The main issue with the previous module was that the `start_shifting` output was not being set correctly. In the original code, the `start_shifting` output was being set to 0 in all states except the `S4` state. This meant that the output was not being held high once the sequence 1101 was detected.

In the corrected module, the `start_shifting` output is initialized to 0 in the reset condition, and is then set to 1 in the `S4` state. This ensures that the output is held high once the sequence is detected, until the reset signal is asserted.

Additionally, the `start_shifting` output is declared as a `reg` type, which is necessary for it to be used as an output in the module.'}
