{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The key changes made are:

1. Initialized the `state` register to `A` when `resetn` is de-asserted.
2. Set `f` to 1 for one clock cycle when transitioning from state `A` to `B`.
3. Implemented the logic to monitor the `x` input and set `g` accordingly in state `D`.
4. Used a 2-bit register `x_history` to keep track of the last two values of `x`.
5. Used a `case` statement to implement the state machine logic.
6. Declared `f` and `g` as `reg` outputs to allow assignment in the `always` block.

This corrected module should now meet the given specification.'}
