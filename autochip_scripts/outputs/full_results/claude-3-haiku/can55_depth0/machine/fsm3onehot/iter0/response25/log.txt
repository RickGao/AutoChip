The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Replaced the individual assign statements with a single always block that assigns values to the next_state bits based on the input `in` and the current state `state`.
2. Corrected the logic for the next_state bits to match the requirements specified in the problem statement.
3. Moved the assignment for the `out` port outside the always block and used a separate assign statement.

The module now compiles without any errors and should function as per the given specification.'}
