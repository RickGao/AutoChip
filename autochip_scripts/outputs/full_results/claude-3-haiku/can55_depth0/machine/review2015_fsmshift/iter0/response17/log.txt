localparam B0 = 3'b000, B1 = 3'b001, B2 = 3'b010, B3 = 3'b011, DONE = 3'b100;

        DONE: shift_ena = 1'b0;
        default: shift_ena = 1'b0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

The main changes made are:

1. Declared a 3-bit state register to represent the different states.
2. Defined the state transition logic using a `case` statement in the first `always` block.
3. Defined the `shift_ena` output based on the current state in the second `always` block.
4. Correctly handled the `DONE` state and the default case.

This module should now correctly implement the given state machine specification.'}
