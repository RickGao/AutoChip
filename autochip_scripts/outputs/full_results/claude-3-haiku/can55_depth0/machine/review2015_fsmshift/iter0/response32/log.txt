Explanation:
1. Declared a 3-bit state register `state` to hold the current state.
2. Defined the state parameters `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, `B3`, and `DONE`.
3. In the first `always` block, the state transitions are implemented based on the reset signal and the current state.
4. In the second `always` block, the `shift_ena` output is set to 1 when the state is `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, or `B3`, and 0 otherwise.'}
