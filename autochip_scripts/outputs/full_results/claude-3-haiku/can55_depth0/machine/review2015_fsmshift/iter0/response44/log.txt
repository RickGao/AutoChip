The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the state register as a 3-bit register `state` to represent the 4 states (B0, B1, B2, B3) and the Done state.
2. Added a reset condition to set the initial state to B0 and enable the shift signal.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the `always` block, transitioning through the states B0 -> B1 -> B2 -> B3 -> Done.
4. Set the `shift_ena` output based on the current state, enabling it when the state is B0, B1, B2, or B3.
5. Added a default case to transition to the Done state for any other invalid state.

The module now correctly implements the described state machine and shift enable logic.'}
