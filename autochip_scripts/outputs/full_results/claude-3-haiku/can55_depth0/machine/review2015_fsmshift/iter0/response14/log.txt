The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared a 3-bit state register `state` to keep track of the current state.
2. In the first `always` block, implemented the state transition logic based on the given specification:
   - When `reset` is high, the state is set to `B0` (3'b000).
   - When `reset` is low, the state transitions from `B0` to `B1`, `B1` to `B2`, `B2` to `B3`, and `B3` to `Done` (3'b100).
   - If the state is not `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, or `B3`, it stays in the `Done` state.
3. In the second `always` block, generated the `shift_ena` signal based on the current state:
   - `shift_ena` is set to 1 when the state is `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, or `B3`.
   - `shift_ena` is set to 0 when the state is `Done`.

This corrected module should now behave according to the given specification.'}
