The corrected Verilog module above includes the following changes:

1. Declared a 3-bit state register to represent the state transitions.
2. In the reset condition, the state is set to 3'b000 (B0).
3. In the non-reset condition, the state transitions are implemented using a case statement.
4. The `shift_ena` output is set to 1 when the state is B0, B1, B2, or B3, and 0 otherwise.

The module now correctly implements the state machine and the specified behavior.'}
