{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a simple counter that increments its output q by one every clock cycle. It has 3 inputs, a clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and an output register (q). The output register is a 4-bit register, meaning it can store values from 0 to 15.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the output register is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active, the output register is incremented by one. When the output register reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it is reset to 1. This process is repeated every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [3:0] q);'}

This Verilog module implements the specification you provided. The key points are:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q` (a 4-bit output register).
2. The module uses an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the code checks the `reset` signal. If `reset` is active, the `q` register is set to 1.
4. If `reset` is not active, the code checks if the current value of `q` is equal to 10 (4'b1010). If so, it sets `q` to 1, otherwise it increments `q` by 1.
5. This process repeats on every clock cycle, creating a counter that counts from 1 to 10 and then resets back to 1.'}
