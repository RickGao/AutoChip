{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a simple counter that increments its output q by one every clock cycle. It has 3 inputs, a clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and an output register (q). The output register is a 4-bit register, meaning it can store values from 0 to 15.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the output register is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active, the output register is incremented by one. When the output register reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it is reset to 1. This process is repeated every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [3:0] q);'}

This Verilog module implements the described counter functionality. The key points are:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q`.
2. The `q` output is a 4-bit register to store the counter value.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
4. Inside the `always` block:
   - If `reset` is active, the counter is set to 1 (`4'b0001`).
   - If `reset` is not active, the counter is checked if it has reached 10 (`4'b1010`).
   - If the counter has reached 10, it is reset to 1.
   - If the counter has not reached 10, it is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures the counter increments by 1 on each clock cycle, resets to 1 when it reaches 10, and resets to 1 when the `reset` signal is active.'}
