The Verilog module provided is correct and should compile without any issues. The key points are:

1. The module has 6 inputs (clk, areset, load, ena, data) and 1 output (q).
2. The module is always sensitive to the rising edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset.
3. When the asynchronous reset is active, the output register `q` is set to 0.
4. When the load signal is active, the data input `data` is loaded into the output register `q`.
5. When the enable signal `ena` is active, the output register `q` is shifted left by 1 bit, effectively performing a left shift operation.
6. When none of the signals are active, the output register `q` remains unchanged.'}
