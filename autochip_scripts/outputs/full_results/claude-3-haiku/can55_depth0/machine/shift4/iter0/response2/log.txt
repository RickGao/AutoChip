{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a 4-bit register. The module has 6 inputs and 1 output. The inputs are a clock (clk), an asynchronous reset (areset), a load signal (load), an enable signal (ena), and a 4-bit data input (data). The output is a 4-bit register (q).  The module is always sensitive to the rising edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. When the asynchronous reset is active, the output register is set to 0. When the load signal is active, the data input is loaded into the output register. When the enable signal is active, the output register is shifted left by 1 bit.

The corrected Verilog module includes the following:

1. The module definition with the correct input and output ports.
2. The always block that is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset signal.
3. The conditional statements that handle the different cases:
   - When the asynchronous reset signal is active, the output register `q` is set to 0.
   - When the load signal is active, the data input `data` is loaded into the output register `q`.
   - When the enable signal is active, the output register `q` is shifted left by 1 bit, with the least significant bit set to 0.
   - If none of the signals are active, the output register `q` remains unchanged.

This corrected module should compile without any errors and function as per the given specification.'}
