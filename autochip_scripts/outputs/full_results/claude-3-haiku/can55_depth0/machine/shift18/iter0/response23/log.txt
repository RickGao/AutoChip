This Verilog module implements the given specification. The key points are:

1. The module has 8 inputs (clk, load, ena, amount[1:0], data[63:0]) and 1 output (q[63:0]).
2. The always block is triggered by the rising edge of the clk signal.
3. Inside the always block, the first if statement checks if the load signal is high, and if so, assigns the data input to the q output.
4. If the load signal is not high, the else if statement checks if the ena signal is high, and then uses a case statement to perform the following operations based on the amount input:
   - 2'b00: Shift q left by 1 bit, filling the rightmost bit with 0.
   - 2'b01: Shift q left by 8 bits, filling the rightmost 8 bits with 0.
   - 2'b10: Shift q right by 1 bit, preserving the leftmost bit.
   - 2'b11: Shift q right by 8 bits, filling the leftmost 8 bits with the leftmost bit of the original q.
5. If the amount input does not match any of the case items, the default case assigns the value 64'hX to q.'}
