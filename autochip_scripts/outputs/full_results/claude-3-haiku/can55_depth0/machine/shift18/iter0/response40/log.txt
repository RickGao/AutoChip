This Verilog module implements the given specification. The main changes are:

1. Declared the `top_module` with the appropriate input and output ports.
2. Added the `always` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.
3. Added the `if` block to handle the `load` condition, which simply assigns the `data` input to the `q` output.
4. Added the `else if` block to handle the `ena` condition, which uses a `case` statement to perform the various shift operations based on the `amount` input.
5. Included the default case to handle any unsupported `amount` values by assigning 'x' to the `q` output.

The module should now compile and function according to the given specification.'}
