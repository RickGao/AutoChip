This Verilog module implements a simple 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999 on the positive edge of the clock. When the reset input is active, the output register `q` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the counter increments `q` by 1 until it reaches 999, at which point it resets back to 0 and the counting cycle begins again.

The key points are:
1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q`.
2. The counter logic is implemented in the `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk`.
3. The `if` statement checks if `reset` is active, and if so, sets `q` to 0.
4. If `reset` is not active, the `else if` statement checks if `q` has reached 999, and if so, resets `q` to 0.
5. If neither `reset` nor `q == 999` is true, the `else` block increments `q` by 1.
6. The output register `q` is declared as a 10-bit wide `reg` type.'}
