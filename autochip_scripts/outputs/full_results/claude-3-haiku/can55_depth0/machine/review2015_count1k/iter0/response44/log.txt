{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a simple counter that counts from 0 to 999. It has three ports, an input clock (clk), an input reset, and an output register (q).

When the reset input is active, the output register is reset to 0. Otherwise, the output register is incremented by 1. When the output register reaches 999, it is reset to 0 and the counting cycle begins again.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [9:0] q);'}

The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module declaration `module top_module(...)` matches the specification.
2. The input ports `clk` and `reset` are declared as specified.
3. The output port `q` is declared as a 10-bit register, as specified.
4. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, as specified.
5. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` input is active, the output register `q` is set to 0.
   - If the output register `q` is equal to 999, it is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the output register `q` is incremented by 1.
6. The `endmodule` statement closes the module definition.

This completed Verilog module should correctly implement the counter functionality described in the specification.'}
