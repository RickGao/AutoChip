{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a simple counter that counts from 0 to 999. It has three ports, an input clock (clk), an input reset, and an output register (q). The output register is 10 bits wide, allowing it to count up to 999.   The module is always triggered on the positive edge of the clock. When the reset input is active, the output register is reset to 0. Otherwise, the output register is incremented by 1. When the output register reaches 999, it is reset to 0 and the counting cycle begins again.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [9:0] q);'}

This module correctly implements the counter functionality as described in the specification. The key points are:

1. The counter value is stored in a 10-bit register `q`.
2. The counter is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `reset` signal is active, the counter is reset to 0.
4. Otherwise, if the counter has reached its maximum value of 999, it is reset to 0.
5. In all other cases, the counter is incremented by 1.

The module is complete and should compile and function as expected.'}
