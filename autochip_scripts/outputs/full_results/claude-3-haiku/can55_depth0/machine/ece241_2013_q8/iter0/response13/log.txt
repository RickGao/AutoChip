The key changes made are:

1. Added the state and next_state registers to keep track of the current and next state.
2. Added the combinational logic to update the next_state based on the current state and the input x.
3. Added the sequential logic to update the state register on the positive edge of the clock with the next_state.
4. Added the output logic to set the output z based on the current state.

This implementation should correctly implement the specified state machine behavior.'}
