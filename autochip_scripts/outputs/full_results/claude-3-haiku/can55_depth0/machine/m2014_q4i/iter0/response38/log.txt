The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. I have made the `out` port a `reg` type, as it is an output port that needs to be assigned a value.
2. Inside the module, I have added an `always` block that assigns the value of `out` to `1'b0` (binary 0) at all times.

This ensures that the `out` port is always assigned the constant value of 0, as specified in the module description.'}
