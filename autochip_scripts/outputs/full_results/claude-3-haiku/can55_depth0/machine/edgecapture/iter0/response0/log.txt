The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `d_last` register to store the previous value of `in`.
2. Added the `reset` condition to initialize `out` and `d_last` to 0 when reset is asserted.
3. Inside the `always` block, first assigned the current `in` value to `d_last`, and then updated the `out` value using the provided logic (`out <= out | (~in & d_last);`).

This module should now correctly implement the given specification.'}
