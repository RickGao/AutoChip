The provided Verilog module specification has been corrected and completed. The key changes are:

1. Declared a register signal `d_last` to store the previous value of `in`.
2. Added the reset condition in the always block, where the `out` and `d_last` signals are initialized to 0.
3. In the else block, the `d_last` signal is assigned the current value of `in`, and the `out` signal is assigned the value of `out` ORed with the NOT of `in` ANDed with the previous value of `in` stored in `d_last`.

The module now correctly implements the described behavior.'}
