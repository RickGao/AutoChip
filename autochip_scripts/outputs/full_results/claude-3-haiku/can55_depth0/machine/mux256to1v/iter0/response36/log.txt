This Verilog module implements the 4-bit selector functionality as described in the problem statement. The main steps are:

1. Calculate the starting index of the 4-bit block in the 1024-bit input vector `in` using the 8-bit selection vector `sel`. The starting index is calculated as `sel * 4`, which gives the 12-bit starting index.
2. Extract the 4-bit block from the `in` vector starting from the calculated index using the `+:` bit-select operator. This assigns the 4-bit block to the output `out` vector.

The module is correctly implemented and should compile without any errors.'}
