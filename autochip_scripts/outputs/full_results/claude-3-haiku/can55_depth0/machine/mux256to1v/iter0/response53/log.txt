The corrected Verilog module performs the following steps:

1. Defines a localparam `BLOCK_SIZE` to represent the size of the selected block, which is 4 bits in this case.
2. Declares a wire `selected_block` to hold the 4-bit block extracted from the input vector `in`.
3. Calculates the starting index of the 4-bit block in the input vector `in` by multiplying the selection vector `sel` with the `BLOCK_SIZE`.
4. Extracts the 4-bit block from the input vector `in` using the `in[start_index +: BLOCK_SIZE]` syntax, which selects a 4-bit block starting from the calculated `start_index`.
5. Assigns the extracted 4-bit block to the output `out`.'}
