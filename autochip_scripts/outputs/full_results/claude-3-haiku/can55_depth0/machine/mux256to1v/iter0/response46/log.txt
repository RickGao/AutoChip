The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key steps are:

1. Calculate the starting index of the 4-bit block in the input vector `in` using the 8-bit selection vector `sel`. This is done by concatenating `2'b00`, `sel`, and `2'b00` to get a 10-bit index value.

2. Extract the 4-bit block from the input vector `in` using the calculated index and the Verilog's slice operator `[index +: 4]`. This will select the 4-bit block starting from the calculated index.

3. Assign the extracted 4-bit block to the output vector `out`.

The provided Verilog module implementation should correctly implement the 4-bit selector functionality as described in the specification.'}
