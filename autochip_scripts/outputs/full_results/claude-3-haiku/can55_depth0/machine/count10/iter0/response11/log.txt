This Verilog module implements a simple counter with the following functionality:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` and `reset`.
2. The module has one output: a 4-bit register `q` that stores the current count value.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
4. Inside the `always` block, an `if-else` statement is used to determine the next value of `q`.
5. If the `reset` input is asserted or the current value of `q` is equal to 9 (4'b1001), then `q` is reset to 0.
6. Otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.

The module is correctly implemented and should not have any compilation errors.'}
