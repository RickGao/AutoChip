This Verilog module implements the Mealy machine as per the given specification:

1. When the input `a` is `1`, the output `q` is set to `4` (binary `100`).
2. When the input `a` is `0` and the current value of `q` is `6` (binary `110`), the output `q` is set to `0` (binary `000`).
3. When the input `a` is `0` and the current value of `q` is not `6`, the output `q` is incremented by `1`.

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The conditional statements inside the block handle the different cases as per the specification.'}
