The key changes are:

1. Added the `always @(posedge clk)` block to update the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. In the first `if` statement, set `q` to 4 when `a` is 1.
3. In the `else if` statement, set `q` to 0 when `a` is 0 and `q` is 6.
4. In the final `else` statement, increment `q` by 1 when `a` is 0 and `q` is not 6.
5. Used the 3-bit assignment syntax `3'd4`, `3'd6`, `3'd0` to ensure the output `q` is a 3-bit value.'}
