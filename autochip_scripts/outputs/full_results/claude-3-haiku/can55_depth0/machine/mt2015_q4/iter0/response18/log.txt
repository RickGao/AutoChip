This Verilog module implements the logic gate described in the specification. The module takes two inputs `x` and `y`, and produces the output `z`. 

The module uses three internal wires `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `out1`, and `out2` to connect the inputs and outputs of the three AND gates. The first AND gate takes `x` and `y` as inputs and produces `out1`. The second AND gate takes `y` and `x` as inputs and produces `out2`. The third AND gate takes `out1` and `out2` as inputs and produces the final output `z`.'}
