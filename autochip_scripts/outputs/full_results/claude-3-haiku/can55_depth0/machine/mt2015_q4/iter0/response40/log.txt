The provided Verilog module specification describes a top-level module `top_module` that implements a logic gate using three sub-modules `and_gate`. The `top_module` takes two inputs `x` and `y`, and produces one output `z`.

The implementation follows the provided specification:
1. The `x` input is connected to the `a` input of the first `and_gate` and the `b` input of the second `and_gate`.
2. The `y` input is connected to the `b` input of the first `and_gate` and the `a` input of the second `and_gate`.
3. The output of the first `and_gate` is connected to the `a` input of the third `and_gate`.
4. The output of the second `and_gate` is connected to the `b` input of the third `and_gate`.
5. The output of the third `and_gate` is connected to the `z` output of the `top_module`.

The `and_gate` module is a simple module that implements an AND gate using the Verilog `assign` statement.'}
