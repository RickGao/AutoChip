The main changes are:

1. Declared the state and next_state registers.
2. Defined the state parameters for the different states.
3. Added the state transition logic in the always block with the `case` statement.
4. Added the output assignment logic in the final always block with the `case` statement.
5. Declared the output registers `f` and `g` as `reg` to allow assignment.

This should provide the completed Verilog module as per the given specification.'}
