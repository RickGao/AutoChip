The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `resetn`: Active-low reset signal
- `x`: Input signal
- `y`: Input signal

Outputs:
- `f`: Output signal
- `g`: Output signal

The module defines the following states:
- `A`, `B`, `S0`, `S1`, `S10`, `G1`, `G2`, `P0`, `P1`

The `current_state` register stores the current state of the FSM, and the `next_state` register is used to update the state based on the input signals and the current state.

The `always` block for the `next_state` logic implements the state transition logic described in the problem statement.

The `always` block for the `f` and `g` output signals sets the values of `f` and `g` based on the current state.

Overall, the provided Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement.'}
