The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has four output registers: `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up`.
2. In the `always` block, the default values for the output registers are set to 0.
3. The `case` statement checks the value of the `scancode` input and sets the corresponding output register to 1 based on the given conditions.
4. If the `scancode` does not match any of the specified values, the outputs remain at their default values of 0.

This module will correctly set the output signals based on the input scancode values as described in the problem statement.'}
