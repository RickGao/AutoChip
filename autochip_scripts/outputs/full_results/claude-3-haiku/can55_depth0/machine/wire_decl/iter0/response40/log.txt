```

The given Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The module implements the desired combinational logic circuit using the provided inputs and outputs. The internal wires `w1` and `w2` are correctly assigned the logical AND of the corresponding inputs, and the output `out` is assigned the logical OR of `w1` and `w2`. The complement output `out_n` is correctly assigned the logical NOT of `out`.

The provided Verilog module is syntactically and logically correct, and no corrections are necessary.'}
