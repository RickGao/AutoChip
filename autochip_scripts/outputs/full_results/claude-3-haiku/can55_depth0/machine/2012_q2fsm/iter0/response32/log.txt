{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  The top module is a state machine that has three inputs (clk, reset, and w) and one output (z). The clk input is a clock signal that is used to synchronize the state transitions. The reset input is a synchronous reset signal that is used to reset the state machine to its initial state. The w input is an input signal that is used to control the state transitions. The z output is an output signal that is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state E or F.  The state machine has six states, A, B, C, D, E, and F, which are represented by a 3-bit register called state. The state transitions are determined by the w input and the current state. The next state is determined by a combinational logic block that is implemented using a case statement. If the w input is 0, the state transitions from A to A, from B to D, from C to D, from D to A, from E to D, and from F to D. If the w input is 1, the state transitions from A to B, from B to C, from C to E, from D to F, from E to E, and from F to C.  The output z is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state E or F. This is implemented by an assign statement that sets the z output to 1 when the state register is equal to either E or F.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput w,\n\toutput z\n);'}

The completed Verilog module for the given specification is as follows:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `reset`, and `w`, and one output: `z`.
2. The state of the state machine is represented by a 3-bit register called `state`, with the following state assignments: `A = 3'b000`, `B = 3'b001`, `C = 3'b010`, `D = 3'b011`, `E = 3'b100`, and `F = 3'b101`.
3. The state transitions are implemented using a `case` statement within an `always` block that is triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal or the `reset` signal.
4. The output `z` is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state `E` or `F`, which is implemented using an `always` block that assigns the value of `z` based on the current state.

The module should compile and function correctly according to the provided specification.'}
