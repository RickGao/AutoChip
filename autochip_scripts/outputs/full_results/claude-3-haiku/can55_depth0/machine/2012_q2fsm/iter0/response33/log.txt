{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  The top module is a state machine that has three inputs (clk, reset, and w) and one output (z). The clk input is a clock signal that is used to synchronize the state transitions. The reset input is a synchronous reset signal that is used to reset the state machine to its initial state. The w input is an input signal that is used to control the state transitions. The z output is an output signal that is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state E or F.  The state machine has six states, A, B, C, D, E, and F, which are represented by a 3-bit register called state. The state transitions are determined by the w input and the current state. The next state is determined by a combinational logic block that is implemented using a case statement. If the w input is 0, the state transitions from A to A, from B to D, from C to D, from D to A, from E to D, and from F to D. If the w input is 1, the state transitions from A to B, from B to C, from C to E, from D to F, from E to E, and from F to C.  The output z is set to 1 when the state machine is in either state E or F. This is implemented by an assign statement that sets the z output to 1 when the state register is equal to either E or F.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput w,\n\toutput z\n);'}

    parameter A = 3'b000, B = 3'b001, C = 3'b010, D = 3'b011, E = 3'b100, F = 3'b101;

            endcase
        end
    end

    assign z = (state == E) | (state == F);

endmodule
```

The main changes are:

1. Declared the `state` register as a 3-bit register to represent the six states.
2. Defined the state parameters (A, B, C, D, E, F) for readability.
3. Implemented the state transitions using a `case` statement inside the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the reset signal.
4. Assigned the `z` output to be 1 when the state is either E or F using the `assign` statement.

This module should now correctly implement the specified state machine behavior.'}
