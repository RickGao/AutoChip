The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is provided above. The module has the following functionality:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `reset`, and a 5-bit output `q`.
2. The module has two always blocks:
   - The first always block is a combinational block that updates the next state of `q` (`q_next`) based on the current state of `q`. It performs the following operations:
     - `q_next[4:1] = q[3:0]`: The upper 4 bits of `q_next` are assigned the values of the upper 4 bits of `q`, effectively shifting the bits one position to the right.
     - `q_next[0] = q[4]`: The least significant bit of `q_next` is assigned the value of the most significant bit of `q`.
     - `q_next[2] = q_next[2] ^ q[4]`: The second bit of `q_next` is assigned the result of XORing the second bit of `q_next` with the most significant bit of `q`.
   - The second always block is a sequential block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. It updates the value of `q` based on the value of `reset` and `q_next`:
     - If `reset` is active, `q` is assigned the value `5'h1` (binary 00001).
     - If `reset` is inactive, `q` is assigned the value of `q_next`.

The provided Verilog module is correct and should compile without any errors.'}
