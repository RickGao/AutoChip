The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the code above is the completed Verilog module that implements the given functionality.

The key points are:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `reset`, and an output `q` of 5-bit width.
2. The module has two `always` blocks:
   a. The first `always` block is triggered by changes in `q` and updates the next state `q_next` based on the current value of `q`.
   b. The second `always` block is triggered by the positive edge of `clk` and updates the output `q` based on the reset signal `reset` or the next state `q_next`.
3. In the first `always` block, the following assignments are made:
   a. `q_next[4:1] = q[4:1]`: The upper 4 bits of `q_next` are assigned the upper 4 bits of the current `q`.
   b. `q_next[4] = q[0]`: The MSB of `q_next` is assigned the LSB of the current `q`.
   c. `q_next[2] = q[0] ^ q_next[2]`: The 3rd bit of `q_next` is assigned the XOR of the LSB of `q` and the previous value of `q_next[2]`.
4. In the second `always` block, the output `q` is assigned either the reset value `5'h1` or the next state `q_next`, depending on the value of `reset`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified functionality.'}
