The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is provided above. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `reset`, and a 5-bit output `q`.
2. The module has two always blocks:
   - The first always block is triggered on a combinational change and updates the next state `q_next` based on the current state `q`.
     - The upper 4 bits of `q_next` are assigned the upper 4 bits of `q`.
     - The least significant bit (LSB) of `q_next` is assigned the LSB of `q`.
     - The second bit of `q_next` is the XOR of the LSB of `q` and the second bit of `q_next`.
   - The second always block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` and updates the current state `q`.
     - If `reset` is active, `q` is assigned the reset value of `5'h1`.
     - If `reset` is inactive, `q` is assigned the next state `q_next`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified state transitions and logic description.'}
