The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the corrected module is provided above. The main changes are:

1. The `always_ff` block is used to capture the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`).
2. Inside the `always_ff` block, the output `out` is assigned the XOR of the previous output `out` and the input `in`.
3. The `logic` data type is used for the output `out` to enable synthesizable Verilog code.

This module implements a simple toggle flip-flop, where the output `out` toggles (changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) on every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, based on the value of the input signal `in`.'}
