{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is used to compare two input signals and generate three output signals.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

- The module takes a 100-bit wide input signal `in` and generates three output signals:
  - `out_both`: a 99-bit wide vector where each bit is 1 only if the corresponding bits of the two input signals are both 1.
  - `out_any`: a 100-bit wide vector where each bit is 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the two input signals is 1.
  - `out_different`: a 100-bit wide vector where each bit is 1 only if the corresponding bits of the two input signals are different.
- The module first shifts the input signal `in` by one bit to the right, resulting in the `in_shifted` signal.
- The `out_both` signal is generated by performing a bitwise AND operation between `in` and `in_shifted`.
- The `out_any` signal is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between `in` and `in_shifted`.
- The `out_different` signal is generated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `in` and `in_shifted`.
- The first bit of `out_different` is assigned by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the most significant bit of `in` and the most significant bit of `in_shifted`.

This implementation correctly fulfills the specified Verilog module requirements.'}
