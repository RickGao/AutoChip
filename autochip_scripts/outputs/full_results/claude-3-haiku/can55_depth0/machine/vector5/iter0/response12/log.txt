The original module had a few issues:
1. The input and output ports were not properly declared.
2. The logic to generate the 5-bit vectors and their inversions was missing.
3. The final XOR operation between the two 25-bit vectors was not implemented.

The corrected module addresses these issues by:
1. Properly declaring the input and output ports.
2. Generating the 5-bit vectors and their inversions using concatenation.
3. Performing the final XOR operation to produce the 25-bit output.'}
