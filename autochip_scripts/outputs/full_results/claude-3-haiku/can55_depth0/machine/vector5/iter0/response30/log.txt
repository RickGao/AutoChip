The original module had the correct logic, but the implementation was not complete. The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared intermediate wires `a_vector`, `b_vector`, `c_vector`, `d_vector`, `e_vector`, `not_vector`, and `and_vector` to construct the required 25-bit vectors.
2. Assigned the 5-bit replicated input signals to the corresponding vector wires using the `{5{}}` syntax.
3. Constructed the `not_vector` by negating the concatenation of the 5 input vector wires.
4. Constructed the `and_vector` by concatenating the 5 input signals.
5. Assigned the bitwise XOR of `not_vector` and `and_vector` to the output `out`.

The corrected module should now compile and function as per the given specification.'}
