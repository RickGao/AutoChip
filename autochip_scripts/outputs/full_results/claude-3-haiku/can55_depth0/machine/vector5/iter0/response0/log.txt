The original module had a few issues:

1. The `a_vec`, `b_vec`, `c_vec`, `d_vec`, and `e_vec` assignments were not correct. They should be assigning the inverted value of the input signals using the `~` operator.
2. The `xor_vec` and `and_vec` assignments were not correct. `xor_vec` should be the concatenation of the 5-bit vectors, and `and_vec` should be the 25-bit vector with the 5 input signals repeated 5 times.
3. The final `out` assignment was missing the bitwise XOR operation between `xor_vec` and `and_vec`.

The corrected module now correctly computes the desired logic.'}
