This Verilog module correctly implements the given specification. The input `in` is an 8-bit vector, and the output `out` is also an 8-bit vector. The output `out` is assigned by reversing the order of the bits in the input `in`. Specifically, `out[0]` is assigned the value of `in[7]`, `out[1]` is assigned the value of `in[6]`, and so on, until `out[7]` is assigned the value of `in[0]`.'}
