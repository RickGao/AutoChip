The main changes made are:

1. Declared the `state` register to hold the current state of the state machine.
2. Defined the `STATE_A` and `STATE_B` parameters to represent the two states.
3. Moved the state transition logic to an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock or the reset signal.
4. Moved the output assignment logic to a separate `always` block that is combinational (no clock sensitivity).
5. Initialized the state to `STATE_A` when the reset signal is high.
6. Included a `default` case in both the state transition and output assignment logic to handle any unexpected states.

This corrected module should now compile and function as per the provided specification.'}
