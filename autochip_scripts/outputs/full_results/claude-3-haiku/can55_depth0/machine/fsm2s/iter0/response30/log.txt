If j is low, the next state remains A. When the state is B, the next state is determined by the input k. If k is high, the next state is A. If k is low, the next state remains B.

The corrected Verilog module is provided. The key changes are:

1. Added `reg` keyword for the `state` register to make it a writable register.
2. Initialized the `state` register to `STATE_A` in the `initial` block.
3. Moved the state transition logic to an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the reset signal.
4. Defined the output logic in a separate `always` block that reacts to changes in the `state` register.
5. Added a `default` case in both the state transition and output logic to handle any unexpected states.

The module now correctly implements the two-state state machine with the desired behavior.'}
