module top_module (

endmodule
```

The original module had a few issues:

1. It was missing the `logic` keyword for the `out` output port declaration.
2. It was missing an intermediate signal `temp` to store the result of the first XOR operation.
3. The logic for the output calculation was missing the intermediate steps.

The corrected module addresses these issues and correctly implements the desired functionality.'}
