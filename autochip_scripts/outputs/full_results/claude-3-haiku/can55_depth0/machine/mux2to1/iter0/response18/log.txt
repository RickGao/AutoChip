The Verilog module you provided is mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `out` output port should be declared as `reg` instead of just `output`. This is because the output value is being assigned inside a `case` statement, which requires a `reg` declaration.
2. The `case` statement should have a `default` case to handle unknown or unspecified values of `sel`. In this case, we set the output to `1'bx` (unknown) to indicate that the output is not well-defined.

With these changes, the corrected Verilog module is provided above.'}
