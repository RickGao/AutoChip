The provided Verilog module is correct and can be used as a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer. The changes made are:

1. Added `reg` keyword to the `out` output to indicate that it is a register-based output.
2. Wrapped the logic in an `always @(*)` block to make it a combinational always block.
3. Used a `case` statement to handle the different values of the `sel` input and assign the appropriate value to the `out` output.
4. Added a `default` case to handle unknown or unspecified `sel` values, setting `out` to an unknown value (`1'bx`).

This module should now function as a proper 2-to-1 multiplexer.'}
