This corrected Verilog module implements a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer. The key changes are:

1. Declared `out` as a `reg` type output, as it is being assigned a value in the `always` block.
2. Used the `always @(*)` construct to create a combinational logic block that determines the value of `out` based on the value of `sel`.
3. Used a simple `if-else` statement to assign the appropriate value to `out` based on the value of `sel`.'}
