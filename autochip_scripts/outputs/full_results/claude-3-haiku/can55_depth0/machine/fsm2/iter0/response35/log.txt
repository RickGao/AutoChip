{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM. If the current state is B, the out port is high, otherwise it is low.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput j,\n\tinput k,\n\tinput areset,\n\toutput out\n);'}

This code implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The key aspects are:

1. The module has two states: `A` and `B`, represented by the `state` and `next_state` registers.
2. The combinational logic block determines the next state based on the current state and the `j` and `k` inputs.
3. The sequential logic block updates the current state on the positive edge of the `clk` input, or when the `areset` input is high (which resets the state to `A`).
4. The output logic sets the `out` signal high when the current state is `B`, and low otherwise.'}
