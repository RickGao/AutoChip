The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. Defining the state parameters `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`.
2. Using a `state` register to store the current state and a `next_state` register to store the next state.
3. Updating the `state` register on the positive edge of the clock, and resetting it to `STATE_B` on the positive edge of `areset`.
4. Implementing the state transition logic in the always block using a case statement.
5. Assigning the output `out` based on the current state.

This implementation should correctly implement the specified state machine behavior.'}
