The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. Declare a state register `state` to store the current state (A or B).
2. Define the state parameters `A` and `B` as 1-bit values.
3. Use a `case` statement in the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or `areset` to update the state based on the current state and the input `in`.
4. Reset the state to `B` on the positive edge of `areset`.
5. Use a combinational `always` block to set the output `out` based on the current state.

This implementation correctly captures the state machine behavior described in the module specification.'}
