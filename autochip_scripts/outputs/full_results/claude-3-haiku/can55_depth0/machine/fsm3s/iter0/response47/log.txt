The module contains the following key components:
1. State variables: `state` and `next_state` to represent the current and next state of the FSM.
2. State parameters: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` to represent the four states of the FSM.
3. State update logic: Updating the `state` register based on the `reset` signal and the `next_state` value.
4. State transition logic: Combinational logic to determine the `next_state` based on the current `state` and the `in` input.
5. Output logic: Combinational logic to set the `out` output based on the current `state`.

The provided module should correctly implement the specified FSM behavior.'}
