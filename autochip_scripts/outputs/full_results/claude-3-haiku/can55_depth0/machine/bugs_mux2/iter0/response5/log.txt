The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `always` block is used to implement the logic based on the value of `sel`.
2. Inside the `case` statement, the appropriate value is assigned to the output `out` based on the value of `sel`.
3. If `sel` is 0, the value of `b` is assigned to `out`.
4. If `sel` is 1, the value of `a` is assigned to `out`.
5. The `default` case is added to handle any unexpected values of `sel`.

This Verilog module should now correctly determine the value of `out` based on the value of `sel` and the data on `a` and `b`.'}
