The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. The `always` block has been added to handle the conditional logic based on the value of `sel`.
2. Inside the `always` block, the `if-else` statement checks the value of `sel`. If `sel` is 0, the value of `out` is assigned the value of `b`. If `sel` is 1, the value of `out` is assigned the value of `a`.
3. The `reg` keyword has been used for the output `out` to make it a writable register.

This module correctly implements the given specification.'}
