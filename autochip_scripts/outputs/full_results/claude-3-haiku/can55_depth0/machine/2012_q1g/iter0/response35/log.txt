The corrections made are:

1. The input port `x` was declared as `[4:1]` instead of `[4:0]`. This has been corrected to match the description.
2. The `always_comb` block was added to handle the combinational logic.
3. The `case` statement was implemented to match the desired output behavior for each value of `x`.
4. The `default` case was added to handle any unspecified input values.'}
