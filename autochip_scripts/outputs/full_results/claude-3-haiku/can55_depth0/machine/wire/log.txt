system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  the top module to the output of the stimulus_gen module. The top module is the module that is being tested.  	The top module contains two inputs, a clock and a reset. The clock is used to synchronize the logic of the module. The reset is used to reset the state of the module. The module also contains two outputs, a data output and a valid output. The data output is used to output the data that is being processed by the module, and the valid output is used to indicate when the data output is valid.  	The top module also contains two internal signals, a state and a counter. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the module, and the counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have passed since the last reset.  	The top module is a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The idle state is the initial state of the module, and is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In the idle state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0.  	When the clock signal is asserted, the FSM transitions to the wait state. In the wait state, the counter is incremented and the data output is set to 0. The FSM remains in the wait state until the counter reaches a certain threshold, at which point it transitions to the process state.  	In the process state, the data output is set to the data that is being processed by the module. The FSM then transitions to the done state. In the done state, the valid output is asserted to indicate that the data output is valid. The FSM then transitions back to the idle state.
