The FSM has four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The idle state is the initial state of the module, and is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In the idle state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0.  \tWhen the clock signal is asserted, the FSM transitions to the wait state. In the wait state, the counter is incremented and the data output is set to 0.

This module implements the functionality described in the provided specification. The module has two inputs, `clock` and `reset`, and two outputs, `data_output` and `valid_output`. The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) with four states: `IDLE`, `WAIT`, `PROCESS`, and `DONE`.

In the `IDLE` state, the module resets the `counter` and sets the `data_output` to 0. When the `clock` signal is asserted, the module transitions to the `WAIT` state.

In the `WAIT` state, the module increments the `counter` and keeps the `data_output` at 0. The module remains in this state until the `counter` reaches a value of 1000, at which point it transitions to the `PROCESS` state.

In the `PROCESS` state, the module sets the `data_output` to the value `0xdeadbeef`, which represents the data being processed by the module. The module then transitions to the `DONE` state.

In the `DONE` state, the module sets the `valid_output` to 1 to indicate that the `data_output` is valid. The module then transitions back to the `IDLE` state.'}
