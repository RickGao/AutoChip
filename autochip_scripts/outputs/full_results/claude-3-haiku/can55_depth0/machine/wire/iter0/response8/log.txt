The top module is the module that is being tested.  \tThe top module contains two inputs, a clock and a reset. The clock is used to synchronize the logic of the module.

The data output is used to output the data that is being processed by the module, and the valid output is used to indicate when the data output is valid.  \tThe top module also contains two internal signals, a state and a counter. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the module, and the counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have passed since the last reset.  \tThe top module is a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The idle state is the initial state of the module, and is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In the idle state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0.  \tWhen the clock signal is asserted, the FSM transitions to the wait state. In the wait state, the counter is incremented and the data output is set to 0. The FSM remains in the wait state until the counter reaches a certain threshold, at which point it transitions to the process state.  \tIn the process state, the data output is set to the data that is being processed by the module.

{'assistant': 'The provided module specification describes a top-level module with the following characteristics:

1. Inputs:
   - `clock`: A clock signal used to synchronize the logic.
   - `reset`: A reset signal used to reset the state of the module.

2. Outputs:
   - `data_output`: The data output of the module.
   - `valid_output`: A signal indicating when the data output is valid.

3. Internal signals:
   - `state`: Keeps track of the current state of the module.
   - `counter`: Keeps track of the number of clock cycles since the last reset.

4. Finite State Machine (FSM) with the following states:
   - `idle`: The initial state, where the counter is reset, and the data output is set to 0.
   - `wait`: In this state, the counter is incremented, and the data output is set to 0. The FSM remains in this state until the counter reaches a certain threshold.
   - `process`: In this state, the data output is set to the data being processed by the module.
   - `done`: In this state, the valid output is asserted to indicate that the data output is valid. The FSM then transitions back to the `idle` state.
