This module implements the specified finite state machine with four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The module takes two inputs, `clk` and `reset`, and produces two outputs, `data_out` and `valid_out`. The `state` register keeps track of the current state of the FSM, and the `counter` register is used to count the number of clock cycles in the `WAIT` state.

The module transitions through the states as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, the module resets the `state`, `counter`, `data_out`, and `valid_out` registers.
2. In the `WAIT` state, the module increments the `counter` register and sets `data_out` to 0. When the `counter` reaches a certain threshold (in this case, 0xFF), the module transitions to the `PROCESS` state.
3. In the `PROCESS` state, the module sets `data_out` to 1 and transitions to the `DONE` state.
4. In the `DONE` state, the module sets `valid_out` to 1 and transitions back to the `IDLE` state.

The module correctly implements the specified behavior and should compile without errors.'}
