This Verilog module implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the specification. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal
- `reset`: The reset signal
- `data_out`: The data output
- `valid_out`: The valid output

The module has four states: `Idle`, `Wait`, `Process`, and `Done`. The state transitions are handled in the `always` block, which updates the state, counter, and data output based on the current state and input signals.

In the `Idle` state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0. The module then transitions to the `Wait` state, where the counter is incremented and the data output is kept at 0. Once the counter reaches the threshold (255 in this case), the module transitions to the `Process` state, where the data output is set to 1. The module then transitions to the `Done` state, where the valid output is asserted to indicate that the data output is valid. Finally, the module transitions back to the `Idle` state.'}
