This Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block inside the module is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 4'b0000 (binary 0). Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1, and if the counter reaches the maximum value of 4'b1111 (binary 15), it is reset to 4'b0000 (binary 0).'}
