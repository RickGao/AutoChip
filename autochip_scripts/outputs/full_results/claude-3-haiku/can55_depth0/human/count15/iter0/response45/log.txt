The corrected Verilog module includes the following:

1. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
2. Inside the `always` block, the `if` statement checks for the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, the counter `q` is reset to `4'b0000`.
3. If `reset` is low, the counter `q` is incremented by 1. The conditional expression `(q == 4'b1111) ? 4'b0000 : q + 1'b1` ensures that the counter wraps around from 15 (binary `1111`) to 0 (binary `0000`).
4. The `output reg [3:0] q` declaration ensures that the 4-bit counter output `q` is a registered output.'}
