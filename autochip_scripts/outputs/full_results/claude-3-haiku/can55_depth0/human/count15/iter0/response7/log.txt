The provided Verilog module specification is correct and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has three ports:
   - `clk`: Clock input
   - `reset`: Synchronous active-high reset input
   - `q`: 4-bit output representing the counter value

2. The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0.
   - If the `reset` signal is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches the maximum value of 15 (4'd15), it is reset to 0.

This Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
