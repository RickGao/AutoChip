The corrected Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `q` output is declared as a 4-bit register (`reg [3:0] q`).
2. The counter logic is implemented in an `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
4. When the `reset` input is low, the counter is incremented by 1 until it reaches 15 (4'b1111), at which point it wraps around to 0.

The ternary operator `(q == 4'b1111) ? 4'b0000 : q + 1'b1` is used to implement the wrap-around logic.'}
