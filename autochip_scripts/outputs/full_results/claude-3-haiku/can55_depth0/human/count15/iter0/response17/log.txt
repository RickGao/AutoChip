The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside the block, it checks if the reset input is high. If it is, the counter value `q` is reset to 0. If the reset is not active, the counter value is incremented by 1, with the counter wrapping around to 0 when it reaches 15 (4'b1111).'}
