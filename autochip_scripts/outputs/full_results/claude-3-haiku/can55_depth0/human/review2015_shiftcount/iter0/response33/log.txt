This Verilog module implements the specified functionality of a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. 

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. 

If `shift_ena` is high, the module shifts in the new bit from the `data` input, placing it in the most significant bit position and shifting the existing bits to the right.

If `count_ena` is high, the module decrements the value stored in the `q` register by 1.

Since the requirements state that `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are never high at the same time, the module simply performs the appropriate operation based on which control signal is active.'}
