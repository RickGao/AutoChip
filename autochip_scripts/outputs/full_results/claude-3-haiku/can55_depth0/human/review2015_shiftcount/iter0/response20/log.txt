The provided module specification is correct, and the above Verilog code implements the desired functionality. The key points are:

1. The module has four inputs: `clk`, `shift_ena`, `count_ena`, and `data`.
2. The module has a 4-bit output register `q` to hold the shift register value.
3. The `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal handles the shift and count operations.
4. When `shift_ena` is 1, the new data is shifted into the MSB of the register, and the existing bits are shifted one position to the right.
5. When `count_ena` is 1, the value in the register is decremented by 1.
6. Since the specification states that `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are not used together, the module does not need to handle the case where both are 1 simultaneously.

This implementation should correctly build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter.'}
