The provided Verilog module correctly implements a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The `always` block handles the logic for the shift register and counter functionality.

When `shift_ena` is 1, the module shifts the input `data` into the most significant bit of the `q` register, and the remaining bits are shifted one position to the right.

When `count_ena` is 1, the module decrements the value stored in the `q` register by 1.

The code handles the case where both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1 by prioritizing the shift operation, as specified in the problem statement.'}
