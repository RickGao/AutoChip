The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as shown above. The module implements a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter.

The logic is as follows:
1. If `shift_ena` is 1, the module shifts the input `data` into the most significant bit of `q`, and the remaining bits are shifted down by one position.
2. If `count_ena` is 1, the module decrements the value in `q` by 1.
3. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1, the module performs the shift operation, as per the given specification, since the full system does not use these control inputs together.

This implementation should meet the requirements of the given Verilog module specification.'}
