The provided Verilog module specification describes a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The module has the following inputs and output:

- `clk`: Clock input
- `shift_ena`: Shift enable input
- `count_ena`: Count enable input
- `data`: Data input
- `q`: Four-bit output register

The module's behavior is as follows:

1. When `shift_ena` is 1, the data input is shifted into the most significant bit of the `q` register, and the existing data in `q` is shifted one position to the right.
2. When `count_ena` is 1, the value in the `q` register is decremented by 1.
3. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are enabled, the module can handle either case, as the specification states that it does not matter which case gets higher priority.

The provided Verilog code implements the described behavior correctly. The `always` block checks the values of `shift_ena` and `count_ena` on the positive edge of the clock, and updates the `q` register accordingly.'}
