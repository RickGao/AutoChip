{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has a 4-bit output register `q` to hold the current value of the shift register.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. If `shift_ena` is high, the module shifts the input `data` into the most significant bit of `q`, and the rest of the bits are shifted to the right by one position.
4. If `count_ena` is high, the module decrements the value in `q` by 1.
5. The module does not care about the case when both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are high, as per the given specification.

This implementation should correctly implement the desired four-bit shift register with a down counter functionality.'}
