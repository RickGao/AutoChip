{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module takes four inputs: `clk`, `shift_ena`, `count_ena`, and `data`.
2. It has a single 4-bit output register `q` to hold the shift register value.
3. Inside the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, the module checks the control inputs:
   - If `shift_ena` is `1`, the shift register `q` is updated by shifting the existing 3 least significant bits left and inserting the new `data` bit at the most significant bit position.
   - If `count_ena` is `1`, the shift register `q` is decremented by 1.
   - If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are `1`, the module will prioritize the shift operation over the decrement operation, as per the specification.

This implementation should correctly implement the four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter.'}
