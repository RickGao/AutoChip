The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has four input ports: `clk`, `shift_ena`, `count_ena`, and `data`, and one output port: `q` (a 4-bit register).
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. If `shift_ena` is 1, the 4-bit register `q` is shifted left by one bit, and the most-significant bit is filled with the value of `data`.
4. If `count_ena` is 1, the value in the 4-bit register `q` is decremented by 1.
5. Since the full system does not use `shift_ena` and `count_ena` together, the module does not need to handle the case where both control inputs are 1.'}
