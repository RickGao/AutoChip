The provided Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_FIRST`, and `STATE_LAST`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The module also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The combinational logic for the next state is defined in the first `always` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`. The combinational logic for the output `z` is defined in the second `always` block, which asserts `z` to 1 when the FSM is in the `STATE_LAST` and the input `x` is 1. The sequential logic for the state register is defined in the third `always` block, which updates the state on the positive edge of the clock and resets the state to `STATE_IDLE` when the asynchronous reset `aresetn` is low.'}
