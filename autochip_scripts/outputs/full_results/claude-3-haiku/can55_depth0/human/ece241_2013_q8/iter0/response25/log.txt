The corrected Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `STATE_INIT`, `STATE_WAIT_1`, and `STATE_DETECT_1`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected, and it is reset to 0 when the sequence is not detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The next state logic in the `always @(*)` block ensures that the FSM correctly transitions between states based on the input `x` and the current state. The output logic is also included in the next state logic, where the `z` output is asserted when the "101" sequence is detected.'}
