The Verilog module above implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses 3 states.

The FSM has the following behavior:

1. In the initial state `S0`, if `x` is 1, the next state is `S1`, otherwise the next state remains `S0`. The output `z` is 0 in this state.
2. In state `S1`, if `x` is 0, the next state is `S2`, otherwise the next state remains `S1`. The output `z` is 0 in this state.
3. In state `S2`, if `x` is 1, the next state is `S1` and the output `z` is asserted to 1, otherwise the next state is `S0` and the output `z` is 0.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning it can detect the "101" sequence even if it is part of a longer sequence like "1101" or "10101".'}

 Iteration rank: 1.0
