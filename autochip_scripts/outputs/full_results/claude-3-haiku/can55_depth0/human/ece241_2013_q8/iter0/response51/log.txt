The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses three states: `IDLE`, `FOUND_1`, and `FOUND_101`.

The `always @(posedge clk, negedge aresetn)` block handles the state updates and the output signal `z` assignment. The `always @(*)` block defines the next state logic based on the current state and the input `x`.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning it can detect the "101" sequence even if it is part of a longer sequence (e.g., "1101").'}
