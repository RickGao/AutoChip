This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `S0`, `S1`, and `S2`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected.

The state transition logic is defined in the first `always` block, which transitions the state based on the current state and the input `x`. The output logic is defined in the second `always` block, where the output `z` is set to 1 when the state is `S2` (the "101" sequence has been detected).

The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal, and the FSM is reset to the initial state `S0` on a negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal `aresetn`.

The FSM is designed to recognize overlapping sequences, meaning that if the input sequence is "1011", the output `z` will be asserted twice, once after the first "101" sequence and again after the second "101" sequence.'}
