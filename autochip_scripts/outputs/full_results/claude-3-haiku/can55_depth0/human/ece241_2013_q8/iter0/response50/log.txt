The above Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `IDLE`, `WAIT_1`, and `WAIT_0`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, and it can recognize overlapping sequences.

The `always` block for the state updates handles the state transitions and the output logic. The `always` block for the next state logic defines the state transition rules based on the current state and the input signal `x`.'}
