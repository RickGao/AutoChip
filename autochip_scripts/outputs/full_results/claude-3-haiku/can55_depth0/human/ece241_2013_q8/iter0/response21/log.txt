The provided Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has three states (IDLE, STATE1, and STATE2) and uses a negative edge-triggered asynchronous reset.

The logic is implemented as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, if the input `x` is 1, the next state is `STATE1`, otherwise, the next state remains `IDLE`. The output `z` is always 0 in the `IDLE` state.
2. In the `STATE1` state, if the input `x` is 0, the next state is `STATE2`, otherwise, the next state returns to `IDLE`. The output `z` is always 0 in the `STATE1` state.
3. In the `STATE2` state, if the input `x` is 1, the next state is `IDLE` and the output `z` is asserted to 1, indicating that the "101" sequence has been detected. If the input `x` is 0, the next state returns to `IDLE` and the output `z` remains 0.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, as it can detect the "101" pattern even if it is part of a longer sequence, such as "1010101".'}
