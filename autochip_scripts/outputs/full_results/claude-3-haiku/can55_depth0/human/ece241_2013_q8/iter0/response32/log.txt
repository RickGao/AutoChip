The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has the following features:

1. Three states: `IDLE`, `START`, and `FOUND`.
2. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected.
3. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset based on the `aresetn` signal.
4. The FSM is capable of recognizing overlapping sequences.

The state transition logic is as follows:

- In the `IDLE` state, if the input `x` is 1, the next state is `START`, otherwise, the next state remains `IDLE`.
- In the `START` state, if the input `x` is 0, the next state is `FOUND`, otherwise, the next state is `IDLE`.
- In the `FOUND` state, the output `z` is asserted to 1. If the input `x` is 1, the next state is `START`, otherwise, the next state is `IDLE`.
- If the state is in an undefined state, the next state is set to `IDLE`, and the output `z` is set to 0.

The module correctly implements the specified Mealy-type finite state machine for recognizing the "101" sequence on the input signal `x`.'}
