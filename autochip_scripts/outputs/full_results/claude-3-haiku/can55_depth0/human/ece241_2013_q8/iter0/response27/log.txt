The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states (`S0`, `S1`, and `S2`) and an additional state (`S3`) where the output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The module also has a negative edge-triggered asynchronous reset based on the `aresetn` signal.

The state transition logic is as follows:
- In the initial state `S0`, the next state is `S1` if `x` is 1, otherwise it remains in `S0`. The output `z` is 0.
- In state `S1`, the next state is `S2` if `x` is 0, otherwise it remains in `S1`. The output `z` is 0.
- In state `S2`, the next state is `S3` if `x` is 1, otherwise it returns to `S0`. The output `z` is 0.
- In state `S3`, the next state is `S3` if `x` is 1, otherwise it returns to `S0`. The output `z` is 1.

This implementation recognizes overlapping sequences of "101" on the input signal `x`.'}
