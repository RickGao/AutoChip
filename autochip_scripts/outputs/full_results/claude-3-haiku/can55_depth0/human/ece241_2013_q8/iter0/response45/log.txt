The provided Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The module also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the state machine to the initial state `S0`.

The module has three states: `S0`, `S1`, and `S2`. The state transition logic is as follows:

- If the current state is `S0` and the input `x` is 1, the next state is `S1`.
- If the current state is `S1` and the input `x` is 1, the next state is `S2`.
- If the current state is `S2` and the input `x` is 1, the next state is `S1`.
- If the current state is `S0`, `S1`, or `S2` and the input `x` is 0, the next state is `S0`.

The output `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the state machine is in the `S2` state, indicating that the "101" sequence has been detected. The output is set to logic-0 in all other states.

The module correctly handles overlapping sequences, as it can detect the "101" sequence even if it is part of a longer sequence (e.g., "1010101").'}
