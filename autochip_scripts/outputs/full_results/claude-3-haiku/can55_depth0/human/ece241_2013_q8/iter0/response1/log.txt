The Verilog module provided implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_ONE`, and `STATE_END`. 

The state transitions are as follows:
1. When the FSM is in `STATE_IDLE` and `x` is 1, the next state is `STATE_ONE`.
2. When the FSM is in `STATE_ONE` and `x` is 0, the next state is `STATE_END`.
3. When the FSM is in `STATE_END` and `x` is 1, the output `z` is asserted to 1 and the next state is `STATE_ONE`.
4. In all other cases, the next state is `STATE_IDLE`.

The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, which sets the state to `STATE_IDLE` when `aresetn` is low.

The module correctly recognizes overlapping sequences and should work as specified.'}
