The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The module has three states: `S0`, `S1`, and `S2`. The state transitions are as follows:

- `S0`: Initial state, `z` is 0. If `x` is 1, transition to `S1`, otherwise stay in `S0`.
- `S1`: If `x` is 1, transition to `S2`, otherwise return to `S0`.
- `S2`: `z` is 1. If `x` is 1, transition to `S1`, otherwise return to `S0`.

The module recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that it can detect the "101" sequence even if it is part of a longer sequence (e.g., "1101", "10101", etc.).'}
