{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1.

The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

```

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine that searches for message boundaries in an input byte stream. The algorithm used is to discard bytes until it sees one with `in[3]=1`, which is then assumed to be the first byte of a message. The module then waits for the next two bytes, and signals the receipt of a complete message once all three bytes have been received.

The module has the following inputs and outputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `in`: The input byte stream.
- `reset`: The synchronous reset signal.
- `out_bytes`: The 24-bit (3 byte) message, with the first byte in `out_bytes[23:16]`, the second byte in `out_bytes[15:8]`, and the third byte in `out_bytes[7:0]`.
- `done`: A signal that is asserted in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.

The module uses a finite state machine with four states:
- `STATE_WAIT`: The initial state, where the module waits for a byte with `in[3]=1`.
- `STATE_MSG1`: The state where the first byte of the message is received and stored in `out_bytes[23:16]`.
- `STATE_MSG2`: The state where the second byte of the message is received and stored in `out_bytes[15:8]`.
- `STATE_MSG3`: The state where the third byte of the message is received and stored in `out_bytes[7:0]`, and the `done` signal is asserted.

The module also maintains a `byte_count` variable to keep track of the number of bytes received for the current message.

The provided Verilog code should correctly implement the specified finite state machine and produce the expected output based on the given waveform example.'}
