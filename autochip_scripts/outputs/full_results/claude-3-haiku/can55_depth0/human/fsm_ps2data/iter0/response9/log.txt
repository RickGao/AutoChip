{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

```

The module implements a finite state machine that searches for the start of a message and then collects the three bytes of the message. The `state` variable keeps track of the current state of the FSM, which can be 0 (waiting for start of message), 1 (receiving second byte), or 2 (receiving third byte). The `byte_count` variable keeps track of how many bytes have been received so far.

When the start of a message is detected (the fourth bit of the input byte is high), the FSM transitions to state 1 and starts storing the bytes of the message in the `message_buffer` register. Once all three bytes have been received, the FSM transitions back to state 0 and asserts the `done` signal.

The `out_bytes` output is always assigned the contents of the `message_buffer` register, so it will be valid whenever the `done` signal is asserted.'}
