{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1.

The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

```

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine to detect message boundaries as described in the problem statement. The module has the following behavior:

1. The module has four states: `WAIT`, `RECV1`, `RECV2`, and `RECV3`.
2. In the `WAIT` state, the module discards bytes until it receives a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which is assumed to be the first byte of a message.
3. Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to the `RECV1` state and stores the byte in the `message` register.
4. In the `RECV1` and `RECV2` states, the module receives the second and third bytes, respectively, and stores them in the `message` register.
5. After the third byte is received, the module transitions back to the `WAIT` state and asserts the `done` signal, indicating that a complete message has been received.
6. The `out_bytes` output is always driven by the `message` register, which contains the 24-bit message (3 bytes) whenever the `done` signal is asserted.
7. The module also handles the synchronous reset signal, which sets the state to `WAIT` and clears the `message` register.

The provided waveform example is correctly handled by this module.'}
