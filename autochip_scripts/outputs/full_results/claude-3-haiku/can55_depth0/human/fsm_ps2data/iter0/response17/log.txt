{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [23:0] out_bytes,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The module implemented here has the following features:

1. It uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state of the finite state machine (FSM).
2. It has three 8-bit registers to store the three bytes of the received message.
3. It has a 24-bit `out_bytes` register to hold the completed message.
4. It has a `done` output signal that is asserted for one cycle when the third byte of a message is received.
5. The FSM has four states:
   - `IDLE`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the first byte with `in[3]` set.
   - `WAIT_SECOND`: This state is entered after the first byte is received, and the module waits for the second byte.
   - `WAIT_THIRD`: This state is entered after the second byte is received, and the module waits for the third byte. Once the third byte is received, the complete message is stored in `out_bytes`, and the `done` signal is asserted.
   - `IDLE`: The FSM returns to the initial state after the third byte is received and the `done` signal is asserted.
6. The module resets the state to `IDLE` and clears the `done` signal when the `reset` input is high.

This implementation matches the provided waveform example and correctly implements the specified finite state machine for searching and capturing message boundaries in the input byte stream.'}
