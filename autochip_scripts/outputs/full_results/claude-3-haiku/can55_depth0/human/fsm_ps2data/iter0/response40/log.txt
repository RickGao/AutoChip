{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

The Verilog module provided above implements the finite state machine to search for message boundaries in an input byte stream. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three registers `byte1`, `byte2`, and `byte3` to store the three bytes of the received message, and a `state` register to track the current state of the FSM.
2. The `done_reg` signal is used to indicate when a complete 3-byte message has been received.
3. In the initial state (0), the FSM waits for the input signal `in[3]` to be high, indicating the start of a message. When this occurs, the first byte is stored in `byte1` and the state is updated to 1.
4. In state 1, the second byte is stored in `byte2`, and the state is updated to 2.
5. In state 2, the third byte is stored in `byte3`, the `done_reg` signal is set to 1, and the state is reset to 0 to wait for the next message.
6. The `out_bytes` output is assigned the concatenation of the three received bytes, and the `done` output is assigned the value of `done_reg`.

The module behaves according to the provided waveform example and meets the specified requirements.'}
