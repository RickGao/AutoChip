{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

```

The module correctly implements the finite state machine to search for message boundaries in the input byte stream. The module has three states:

1. **Searching for start of packet**: In this state, the module discards bytes until it encounters a byte with `in[3]` set to 1. Once this is detected, it transitions to the next state and stores the first byte in the buffer.

2. **Receiving second byte**: In this state, the module stores the second byte in the buffer and transitions to the next state.

3. **Receiving third byte**: In this state, the module stores the third byte in the buffer and transitions back to the first state. It also asserts the `done` signal to indicate that a complete 3-byte message has been received.

The `out_bytes` output is updated with the 3-byte message whenever the `done` signal is asserted. The module correctly handles the reset signal and resets the state machine and output buffer when `reset` is high.'}
