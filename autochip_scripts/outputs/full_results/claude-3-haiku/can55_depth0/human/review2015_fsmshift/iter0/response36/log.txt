The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `shift_ena` output as a `reg` to allow it to be assigned a value.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. Included a counter `count` to track the number of clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state.
4. Updated the `always @(*)` block to handle the state transitions and set the `shift_ena` output correctly.
5. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to 0, and it transitions to the `SHIFT` state when `reset` is asserted.
6. In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` is set to 1, and it transitions to the `DONE` state when the counter reaches 3 (4 clock cycles).
7. In the `DONE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to 0, and it transitions back to the `SHIFT` state when `reset` is asserted.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` output is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then it remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
