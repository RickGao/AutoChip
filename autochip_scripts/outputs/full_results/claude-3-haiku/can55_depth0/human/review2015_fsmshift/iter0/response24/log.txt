The corrected module achieves the desired functionality:

1. The module has a reset signal that is active high and synchronous.
2. Whenever the reset signal is asserted, the module enters the `IDLE` state and sets `shift_ena` to 1'b1 for 4 clock cycles (defined by the `CYCLES` parameter).
3. After the 4 cycles, the module transitions to the `DONE` state and keeps `shift_ena` at 0 forever (until the next reset).
4. The module uses a two-bit state register to keep track of the current state and transitions between the states based on the reset signal and the number of cycles.'}
