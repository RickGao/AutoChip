The module provided has been corrected to meet the requirements. The key changes are:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output signal.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `always` block for the state transitions, added the logic to handle the reset condition and transition to the `SHIFT` state.
4. In the `SHIFT` state, the module keeps track of the count using a 2-bit counter, and transitions to the `DONE` state when the count reaches 3 (4 clock cycles).
5. In the `DONE` state, the module transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
6. The `shift_ena` output is asserted high during the `SHIFT` state, and is held low in all other states.

This modified module should now meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.'}
