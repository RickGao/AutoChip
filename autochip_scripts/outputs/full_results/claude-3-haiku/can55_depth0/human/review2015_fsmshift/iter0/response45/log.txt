The provided module specification has been corrected and implemented in the above Verilog code. The key changes are:

1. Added a register `shift_ena` to control the enable signal for the shift register.
2. Defined a state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `WAIT`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` is asserted to 1 and the state transitions to `SHIFT`.
4. In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` is kept at 1 and the state transitions to `WAIT` after 4 clock cycles.
5. In the `WAIT` state, the `shift_ena` is deasserted to 0 and the state transitions back to `IDLE`.
6. The reset signal is handled synchronously, where the state is set to `IDLE` and `shift_ena` is asserted to 1.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then kept at 0 until the next reset.'}
