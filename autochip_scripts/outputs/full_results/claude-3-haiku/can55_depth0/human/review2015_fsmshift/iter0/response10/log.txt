The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Added a register `shift_ena` to control the shift enable signal.
2. Defined a localparam `SHIFT_CYCLES` to keep track of the number of cycles the shift enable should be asserted after reset.
3. Defined three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `RESET`.
4. In the `RESET` state, the `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1` and the `SHIFT_CYCLES` counter is incremented until it reaches 4, at which point the state transitions to `IDLE`.
5. In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1` if it was previously `1'b1`, otherwise it is set to `1'b0`.
6. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to `1'b0`.'}
