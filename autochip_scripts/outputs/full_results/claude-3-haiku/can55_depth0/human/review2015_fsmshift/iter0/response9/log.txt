The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output.
2. Defined the state machine with `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE` states.
3. Included a counter to track the number of clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state.
4. Updated the `always` block for state transitions and the `shift_ena` output.
5. Ensured that `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state and deasserted in the `DONE` state.
6. Reset the counter and state to `IDLE` when the `reset` signal is active.

This module should now correctly implement the desired FSM behavior.'}
