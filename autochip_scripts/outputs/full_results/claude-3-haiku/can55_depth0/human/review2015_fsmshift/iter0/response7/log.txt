The corrected Verilog module has the following features:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the reset signal, and an output `shift_ena` to indicate when the shift register should be enabled.
2. The module uses a counter `count` to track the number of cycles that the shift register should be enabled.
3. When the `reset` signal is high, the module resets the counter to 0 and sets `shift_ena` to 1 for `CYCLES` (which is set to 4) cycles.
4. After the initial `CYCLES` cycles, the module sets `shift_ena` to 0 until the next reset.
5. The module uses a `always` block to update the `count` and `shift_ena` signals on the positive edge of the clock.'}
