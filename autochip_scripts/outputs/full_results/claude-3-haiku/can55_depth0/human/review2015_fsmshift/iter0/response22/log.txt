The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Declared `shift_ena` as a register output instead of a wire.
2. Implemented a state machine with three states: IDLE, SHIFT, and DONE.
3. In the IDLE state, the module asserts `shift_ena` for 1 cycle and then transitions to the SHIFT state.
4. In the SHIFT state, the module continues to assert `shift_ena` until 4 cycles have elapsed, at which point it transitions to the DONE state.
5. In the DONE state, the module deasserts `shift_ena` and remains in this state until a reset occurs, at which point it transitions back to the IDLE state.
6. The default case in the case statement ensures that the module starts in the IDLE state and `shift_ena` is deasserted if an unknown state is reached.

This implementation ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
