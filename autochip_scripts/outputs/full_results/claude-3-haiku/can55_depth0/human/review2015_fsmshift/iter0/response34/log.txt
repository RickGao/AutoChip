The provided module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The module includes the following features:

1. The module has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `IDLE` and the count to 0 when `reset` is high.
2. The module has three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, `shift_ena` is low, and the next state is either `SHIFT` if `reset` is high or `IDLE` if `reset` is low.
4. In the `SHIFT` state, `shift_ena` is high, and the next state is `DONE` if the count has reached 3 (2'b11) or `SHIFT` if the count has not reached 3.
5. In the `DONE` state, `shift_ena` is low, and the next state is `IDLE`.

The module correctly implements the desired behavior of asserting `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keeping `shift_ena` low until the next reset.'}
