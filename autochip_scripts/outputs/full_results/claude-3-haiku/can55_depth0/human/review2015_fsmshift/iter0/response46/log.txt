The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output signal to make it a register that can be updated.
2. Defined the `CYCLES` parameter to control the number of clock cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. Defined the state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `ACTIVE`, and `DONE`.
4. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1` and the state is transitioned to `ACTIVE`.
5. In the `ACTIVE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1` until the `CYCLES` counter reaches 4, at which point the state is transitioned to `DONE` and `shift_ena` is set to `1'b0`.
6. In the `DONE` state, the `shift_ena` is maintained at `1'b0` until the next reset.
7. The default case sets the state to `IDLE` and `shift_ena` to `1'b0`.

This module should now correctly enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and reset the `shift_ena` to `0` after 4 cycles until the next reset.'}
