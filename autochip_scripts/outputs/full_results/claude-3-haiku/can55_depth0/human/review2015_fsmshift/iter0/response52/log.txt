The corrected module includes the following:

1. Declared the `shift_ena` as a `reg` output.
2. Declared a 2-bit register `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles.
3. In the `always` block:
   - Checked for the `reset` condition and initialized `count` to 0 and `shift_ena` to 1.
   - If `count` is 3 (0b11), set `shift_ena` to 0 to disable the shift register.
   - Otherwise, keep `shift_ena` high and increment the `count`.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
