The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Added a register `shift_ena` to output the shift enable signal.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: IDLE, SHIFT, and HOLD.
3. Implemented the state transition logic based on the state and the counter value.
4. Asserted `shift_ena` during the SHIFT state and deasserted it during the other states.
5. Reset the counter and transitioned to the SHIFT state when the reset signal is asserted.

This module should now correctly enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and assert `shift_ena` for 4 cycles during reset, then deassert it forever (until the next reset).'}
