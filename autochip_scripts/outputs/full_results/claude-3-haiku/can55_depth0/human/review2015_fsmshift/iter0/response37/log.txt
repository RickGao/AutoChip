The corrected Verilog module meets the given specification:

1. The module has a `clk`, `reset`, and `shift_ena` ports as specified.
2. The module uses a 2-bit register `count` to keep track of the number of cycles to assert `shift_ena`.
3. Upon reset, the module sets `count` to `INIT_COUNT` (4) and asserts `shift_ena` to 1.
4. On each subsequent clock cycle, the module decrements `count` while `shift_ena` is asserted.
5. Once `count` reaches 0, the module deasserts `shift_ena` to 0 until the next reset.

This implementation ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
