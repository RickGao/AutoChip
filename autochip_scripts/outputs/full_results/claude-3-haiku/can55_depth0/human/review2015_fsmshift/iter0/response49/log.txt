This Verilog code implements the desired functionality of the FSM for controlling the shift register. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` has two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (active high synchronous reset), and one output: `shift_ena` (shift enable).
2. The module uses a 2-bit state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `ENABLE`, and `COUNT`.
3. The `always` block for the state register updates the current state based on the next state, and the reset signal.
4. The `always` block for the next state and output logic handles the state transitions and the `shift_ena` output:
   - In the `IDLE` state, if `reset` is high, the next state is `ENABLE`; otherwise, the next state remains `IDLE`, and `shift_ena` is set to 0.
   - In the `ENABLE` state, the next state is `COUNT`, and `shift_ena` is set to 1.
   - In the `COUNT` state, if `reset` is high, the next state is `ENABLE`; if `shift_ena` is 1, the next state remains `COUNT`, and `shift_ena` is still 1; otherwise, the next state is `IDLE`, and `shift_ena` is set to 0.
   - In the default case, the next state is `IDLE`, and `shift_ena` is set to 0.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified functionality for the FSM controlling the shift register.'}
