The module you provided has the correct functionality, but it was missing the `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output. I've added the `reg` declaration to the `shift_ena` output, and the module should now be complete and correct.

The module operates as follows:
1. When `reset` is asserted, the `count` register is reset to 0, and `shift_ena` is set to 1 for the first 4 clock cycles.
2. After the first 4 clock cycles, `count` is reset to 0 and `shift_ena` is set to 0 until the next reset.
3. During the 4 clock cycles where `shift_ena` is 1, the shift register can be enabled.'}
