The provided Verilog module is a Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the shift register. The main functionality is as follows:

1. Whenever the `reset` signal is asserted (active high), the module enters the `IDLE` state and asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles.
2. After the 4 clock cycles, the module transitions to the `DONE` state and keeps the `shift_ena` signal deasserted (0) until the next reset.
3. If the `reset` signal is asserted while the module is in the `DONE` state, it will transition back to the `IDLE` state and repeat the 4-cycle `shift_ena` assertion.

The module uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state of the FSM, and the `shift_ena` output is controlled based on the current state.'}
