The original module specification has been corrected to include the following:

1. The `shift_ena` output is declared as a `reg` type, as it needs to be assigned a value in the Verilog code.
2. The state machine has been implemented using two state variables, `state` and `next_state`, to keep track of the current state and the next state, respectively.
3. The `reset` behavior has been added, where the state is set to 0 and the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for 4 clock cycles when the `reset` signal is high.
4. The `state` transition logic has been implemented in the `always` block, which updates the `next_state` based on the current `state`.
5. The `shift_ena` signal is asserted for 4 clock cycles when the state is 0, and then deasserted until the next reset.

This corrected module should now meet the specified requirements.'}
