The module you provided has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `shift_ena` output is not being properly controlled. It should be asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is in the `SHIFT` state, and deasserted otherwise.
2. The `counter` variable is needed to keep track of the number of clock cycles the `shift_ena` signal has been asserted in the `SHIFT` state.
3. The `next_state` logic is not complete, as it doesn't handle the case where the FSM is in the `SHIFT` state and the `counter` reaches 3 (the 4th cycle).

The corrected module is provided above, which addresses these issues. The key changes are:

1. Added a `counter` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state.
2. Updated the `next_state` logic to transition from `SHIFT` to `IDLE` when the `counter` reaches 3.
3. Updated the `output` logic to assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state, and deassert it otherwise.

The module should now function as per the given specification.'}
