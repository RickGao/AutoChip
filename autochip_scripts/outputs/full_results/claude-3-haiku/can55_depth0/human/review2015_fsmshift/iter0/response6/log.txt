The provided Verilog module is correct and should function as expected. It has the following features:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `shift_ena`.
2. The `SHIFT_CYCLES` parameter is set to 4, which determines the number of cycles the `shift_ena` signal is asserted.
3. The module uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state.
4. When the `reset` signal is asserted, the module resets the state to 0 and asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 cycles.
5. When the `reset` signal is not asserted, the module cycles through the 4 states, asserting the `shift_ena` signal for each state.
6. After the 4 cycles, the module resets the state to 0 and continues the cycle.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then remains at 0 until the next reset.'}
