The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared a `shift_ena` output as a register to enable the shift register.
2. Defined a `SHIFT_CYCLES` parameter to keep track of the number of cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. Defined a state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
4. In the `IDLE` state, the module sets `shift_ena` to 1 and transitions to the `SHIFT` state.
5. In the `SHIFT` state, the module keeps `shift_ena` high and increments the `SHIFT_CYCLES` counter until it reaches 4, at which point it transitions to the `DONE` state.
6. In the `DONE` state, the module sets `shift_ena` to 0 and stays in that state until the next reset.
7. The reset is handled synchronously, where the module transitions to the `IDLE` state and sets `shift_ena` to 1.

This corrected module should correctly enable the shift register for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keep `shift_ena` at 0 until the next reset.'}
