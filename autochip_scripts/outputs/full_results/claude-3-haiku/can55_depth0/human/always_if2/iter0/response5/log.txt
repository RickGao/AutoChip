The corrected issues in the original code are:

1. The `always` blocks were missing the `begin-end` blocks, which are necessary for multiple statements within the same `always` block.
2. The `shut_off_computer` output was being assigned directly in the `always` block, but it should be assigned using the `reg` data type.
3. The `keep_driving` output was being assigned the negation of `gas_tank_empty` when `arrived` was `0`, but it should be `0` when `arrived` is `1`.

The corrected module correctly sets the `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` outputs based on the input signals.'}
