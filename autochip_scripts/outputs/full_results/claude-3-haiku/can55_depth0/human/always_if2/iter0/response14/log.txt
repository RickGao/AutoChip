The corrected version of the provided Verilog module has the following changes:

1. The `always` block for `shut_off_computer` was missing the `else` block, so it was not being set to 0 when `cpu_overheated` was false. The `else` block has been added to ensure that `shut_off_computer` is correctly set to 0 when `cpu_overheated` is false.

2. The comparison operator in the `if` condition for `keep_driving` was using the unary negation operator (`~`) instead of the logical negation operator (`!`). The logical negation operator has been used to correctly check if `arrived` is false.

3. The `keep_driving` output was not being set correctly when `arrived` was true. An `else` block has been added to set `keep_driving` to 0 when `arrived` is true.

These changes address the issues in the original code and ensure that the Verilog module is correctly implemented.'}
