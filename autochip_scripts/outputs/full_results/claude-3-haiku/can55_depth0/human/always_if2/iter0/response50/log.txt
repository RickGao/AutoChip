    end

endmodule
```

The original code had two issues:

1. In the first always block, the assignment for `shut_off_computer` was missing the `= 1;` part, so it was not actually setting the output.
2. In the second always block, the condition for `keep_driving` was incorrect. It should be `~arrived & ~gas_tank_empty` to keep driving if the car has not arrived and the gas tank is not empty.

The corrected code addresses these issues and should now work as expected.'}
