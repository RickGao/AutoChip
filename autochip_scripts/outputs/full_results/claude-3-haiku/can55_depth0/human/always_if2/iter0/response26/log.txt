```

The issues with the original code:

1. The `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` outputs were not being properly assigned. The code was only setting the output when the condition was true, but not setting it to 0 when the condition was false.
2. The second `always` block was missing the `else` condition to set `keep_driving` to 0 when `arrived` is true.

The corrected code:
- In the first `always` block, the `shut_off_computer` output is set to 1 when `cpu_overheated` is true, and 0 otherwise.
- In the second `always` block, the `keep_driving` output is set to `~gas_tank_empty` when `arrived` is false, and 0 when `arrived` is true.'}
