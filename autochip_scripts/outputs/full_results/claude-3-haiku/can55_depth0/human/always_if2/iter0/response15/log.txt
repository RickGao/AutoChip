The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. The `always` block for `shut_off_computer` output was missing the `else` case, which would leave the output in an undefined state when `cpu_overheated` is false. The corrected code sets `shut_off_computer` to 0 in the `else` case.

2. The comparison operator in the `if` condition for the `keep_driving` output was using the bitwise negation operator `~` instead of the logical negation operator `!`. The corrected code uses the logical negation operator `!` to check if `arrived` is false.

3. The `keep_driving` output was being assigned the negated value of `gas_tank_empty` when `arrived` is false. The corrected code assigns 0 to `keep_driving` when `arrived` is true, as per the problem statement.'}
