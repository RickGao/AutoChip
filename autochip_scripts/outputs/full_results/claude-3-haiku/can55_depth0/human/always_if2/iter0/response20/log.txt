The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. The `shut_off_computer` output was missing an `else` statement to set it to 0 when `cpu_overheated` is not true.
2. The `keep_driving` output was using the wrong logic to set it to `!gas_tank_empty` when `!arrived` is true. The original code would keep driving even when `arrived` is true, which is incorrect.
3. The `keep_driving` output was also missing an `else` statement to set it to 0 when `arrived` is true.

The corrected module now properly handles the logic for shutting off the computer when it overheats, and for keeping the car driving when the user has not arrived at the destination and the gas tank is not empty.'}
