The corrected module has the following changes:

1. The `shut_off_computer` output was missing the `reg` declaration, so it has been added.
2. The `keep_driving` output was missing the `reg` declaration, so it has been added.
3. In the first always block, the `shut_off_computer` output was being assigned `1` if `cpu_overheated` was true, but it was not being assigned `0` when `cpu_overheated` was false. This has been corrected.
4. In the second always block, the condition `~arrived` was using the bitwise NOT operator, which is not necessary. The logical NOT operator `!` has been used instead.
5. In the second always block, the `keep_driving` output was being assigned the negation of `gas_tank_empty` when `!arrived` was true, but it was not being assigned a value when `arrived` was true. This has been corrected.'}
