This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures. Describe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion).

The corrected Verilog module above represents the described FSM. The key changes are:

1. Added the state encoding parameters for the four states (A, B, C, D).
2. Implemented the state update logic in a separate always block, where the current state is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and upon reset, the state is set to A.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in a separate always block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the input request signals (r[1], r[2], r[3]).
4. Assigned the output grant signals (g[1], g[2], g[3]) using continuous assignment statements, where each grant signal is set to 1 when the FSM is in the corresponding state.

This implementation follows the structure and guidelines provided in the problem statement.'}
