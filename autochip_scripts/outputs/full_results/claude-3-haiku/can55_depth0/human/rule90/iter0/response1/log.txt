{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key features are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `load` to indicate when the initial state `data[511:0]` should be loaded, and an output `q[511:0]` that represents the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. In the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock, the module first checks if the `load` input is high. If so, it loads the initial state from `data[511:0]` into `q[511:0]`.

3. If `load` is not high, the module calculates the next state of each cell in the cellular automaton based on the Rule 90 logic. The first and last cells are handled separately to account for the boundary conditions (assumed to be 0).

4. The new state is stored back into `q[511:0]`, ready to be used in the next clock cycle.

This implementation should correctly simulate the 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton as specified in the problem statement.'}
