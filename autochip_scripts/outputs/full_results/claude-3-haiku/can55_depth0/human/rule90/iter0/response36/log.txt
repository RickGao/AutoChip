{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

The provided code is a correct Verilog module that implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton. The module has the following features:

1. The module takes in a clock signal (`clk`), a load signal (`load`), and a 512-bit input data (`data`).
2. The module has a 512-bit output register (`q`) that stores the current state of the cellular automaton.
3. On each positive edge of the clock, the module checks the `load` signal:
   - If `load` is high, the module assigns the input `data` to the output `q`.
   - If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of each cell in the cellular automaton:
     - The first cell (`q[0]`) is assigned the value of the second cell (`q[1]`).
     - The last cell (`q[511]`) is assigned a constant value of `1'b0` (off).
     - For the remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is computed as the XOR of the current state of the left and right neighbors (`q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`).

This implementation correctly models the Rule 90 cellular automaton and advances the state of the system by one time step on each clock cycle.'}
