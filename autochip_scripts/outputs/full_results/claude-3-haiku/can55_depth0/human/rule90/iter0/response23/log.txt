{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `q` register is a 512-bit vector that holds the current state of the cellular automaton.
2. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the cellular automaton from the `data` input.
3. On each clock cycle, the next state of the cellular automaton is updated by XORing the current state of each cell with its two neighbors (except for the boundary cells, which are assumed to be 0).
4. The boundary conditions are handled by assigning the value of `q[1]` to `q[0]`, as the problem statement assumes that `q[-1]` is always 0.

The module should correctly implement the Rule 90 cellular automaton and advance the state of the system by one time step on each clock cycle.'}
