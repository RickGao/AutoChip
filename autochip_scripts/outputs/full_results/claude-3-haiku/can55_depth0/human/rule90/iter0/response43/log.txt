{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The Verilog module provided implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the given specification. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has input ports `clk`, `load`, and `data[511:0]`, and an output port `q[511:0]`.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. If the `load` signal is high, the state of the system `q[511:0]` is updated with the value of `data[511:0]`.
4. If the `load` signal is low, the state of the system is updated according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is updated with the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0, as per the boundary condition.
   - For the remaining cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the new state is calculated as the XOR of the left and right neighbors.

This implementation correctly captures the behavior of the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement.'}
