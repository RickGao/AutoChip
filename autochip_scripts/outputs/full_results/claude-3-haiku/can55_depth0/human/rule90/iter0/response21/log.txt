{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0].

The provided Verilog module specification describes a 512-cell system that implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

1. `clk`: The clock signal.
2. `load`: An input that indicates the state of the system should be loaded with `data[511:0]`.
3. `data[511:0]`: The initial state of the 512-cell system.
4. `q[511:0]`: The current state of the 512-cell system.

The module's behavior is as follows:

1. On a positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), the module checks if the `load` input is active.
2. If `load` is active, the module assigns the value of `data[511:0]` to `q[511:0]`.
3. If `load` is not active, the module updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is assigned the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is assigned the value of 0 (off) to represent the boundary condition.
   - For the remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is calculated as the XOR of the current cell and its two neighbors.

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the specified 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton system.'}
