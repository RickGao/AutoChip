{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `q` register is a 512-bit wide register that stores the state of the 512-cell system.
2. On the `clk` positive edge:
   - If `load` is high, the state `q` is loaded with the `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the next state of `q` is computed as per the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
     - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0 (off), since the boundary condition is assumed to be 0.
     - For all the other cells `q[i]` where `i` is between 1 and 510, the next state is computed as the XOR of the current left and right neighbors, `q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`.

This implementation correctly advances the state of the 512-cell system by one time step on each clock cycle, as per the Rule 90 cellular automaton rules.'}
