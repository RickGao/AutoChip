{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has four ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input.
   - `load`: The load signal that indicates the state of the system should be loaded with `data[511:0]`.
   - `data[511:0]`: The input data that should be loaded into the system when `load` is high.
   - `q[511:0]`: The output of the cellular automaton, which represents the state of the 512-cell system.

2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`).
3. If the `load` signal is high, the current state of the system (`q[511:0]`) is updated to the input data (`data[511:0]`).
4. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of the system is calculated according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell (`q[0]`) is assigned the value of the second cell (`q[1]`), since the left neighbor of the first cell is assumed to be 0.
   - The last cell (`q[511]`) is assigned the value 0, since the right neighbor of the last cell is assumed to be 0.
   - For the rest of the cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is calculated as the XOR of the current cell's left and right neighbors.

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton.'}
