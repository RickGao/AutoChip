{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `q` register is used to store the current state of the 512-cell system.
2. On the positive edge of the clock, the module checks if the `load` input is active. If so, it loads the `data` input into the `q` register.
3. If the `load` input is not active, the module computes the next state of the system using the Rule 90 principle:
   - The leftmost cell (`q[0]`) is set to the value of the second cell (`q[1]`).
   - The rightmost cell (`q[511]`) is set to 0, as per the problem statement.
   - For all other cells, the next state is computed as the XOR of the current cell and its two neighbors.

This implementation should correctly advance the state of the 512-cell system by one time step each clock cycle, as per the problem description.'}
