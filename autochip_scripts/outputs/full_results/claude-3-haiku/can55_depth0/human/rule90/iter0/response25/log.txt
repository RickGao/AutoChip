{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. The `load` input is used to initialize the system with the given `data` input. On each clock cycle, the module updates the state of the cells according to the XOR rule, with the boundary conditions set to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The state of the cells is stored in the 512-bit `q` register.
2. The `if (load)` block sets the initial state of the cells based on the `data` input.
3. The `else` block computes the next state of each cell using the XOR rule, with the boundary conditions set to 0.
4. The `for` loop iterates over the internal cells (from 1 to 510) and updates their state based on the XOR of their left and right neighbors.
5. The first and last cells are updated separately to handle the boundary conditions.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell system correctly advances by one time step each clock cycle, as per the given specification.'}
