This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module takes a 512-bit input `data` and a `load` signal to initialize the state of the cells.
2. The `q` register stores the current state of the 512 cells, with `q[0]` representing the leftmost cell and `q[511]` representing the rightmost cell.
3. On each clock cycle, if `load` is high, the module loads the new state from `data`. Otherwise, it computes the next state of each cell based on the Rule 90 logic.
4. The boundary conditions are handled by setting `q[0]` to the value of `q[1]` (since `q[-1]` is assumed to be 0) and `q[511]` to 0 (since `q[512]` is assumed to be 0).
5. The rest of the cells update their state based on the XOR of their left and right neighbors.'}
