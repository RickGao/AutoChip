{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}
{'assistant': 'Here is the completed Verilog module for the given specification:

```verilog
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [511:0] data,
	output reg [511:0] q);

	// Assign initial state on load
	always @(posedge clk) begin
		if (load) begin
			q <= data;
		end
		else begin
			// Compute next state using Rule 90
			q[0] <= q[1];
			q[511] <= q[510];
			for (genvar i = 1; i < 511; i++) begin
				q[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
			end
		end
	end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `load` input is used to assign the initial state of the system from the `data` input.
2. For the next state computation, the boundary conditions are explicitly handled by assigning `q[0]` and `q[511]` based on the neighboring cells.
3. The inner cells are updated using the XOR rule of the left and right neighbors, as per the given specification.
4. The update is done in a single always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

This should provide the desired 512-cell cellular automaton system implementing the Rule 90 behavior.'}
