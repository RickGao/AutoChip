{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has a clock input `clk` and a load input `load`. When `load` is high, the module loads the provided `data` into the `q` register.
2. When `load` is not high, the module computes the next state of each cell in the 512-cell system based on the Rule 90 cellular automaton logic.
3. The boundary conditions are handled by assuming that `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are both zero (off).
4. The updated state of the 512-cell system is stored in the `q` register and is the output of the module.'}
