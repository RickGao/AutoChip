{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The main aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `load` to indicate when the initial state should be loaded from `data[511:0]`, and an output `q[511:0]` that represents the state of the 512-cell system.

2. In the `always` block that runs on the positive edge of the clock, the module first checks if the `load` signal is high. If so, it simply assigns the input `data[511:0]` to the output `q[511:0]`.

3. If `load` is not high, the module updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton. The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are assigned the values of their immediate neighbors (`q[1]` and `0`, respectively), as per the problem statement.

4. For the remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the new state is computed as the XOR of the current cell's left and right neighbors, as per the Rule 90 specification.

This implementation should correctly simulate the Rule 90 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system, advancing the state by one time step each clock cycle, and loading the initial state from the `data[511:0]` input when the `load` signal is high.'}
