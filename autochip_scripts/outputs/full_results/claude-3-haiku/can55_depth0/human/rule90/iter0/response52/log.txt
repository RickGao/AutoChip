{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code creates a 512-cell system that implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` for the clock, `load` to indicate when the system should be loaded with the initial state (`data`), and `data` which is a 512-bit input representing the initial state of the cells.
2. The module has one output, `q`, which is a 512-bit register that holds the current state of the cells.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` input is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new state from `data`.
5. If the `load` input is low, the next state of the system is computed using the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]`, representing the boundary condition `q[-1] = 0`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0, representing the boundary condition `q[512] = 0`.
   - For all other cells `q[i]` where `i` is between 1 and 510, the next state is computed as the XOR of the two neighboring cells `q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell system is updated according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton with the correct boundary conditions.'}
