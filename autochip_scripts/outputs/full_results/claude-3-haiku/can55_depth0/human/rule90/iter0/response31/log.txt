{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `load` to load the initial state, an input `data[511:0]` for the initial state, and an output `q[511:0]` for the current state.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, the module checks if the `load` signal is high. If so, it assigns the `data` input to the `q` output.
3. If `load` is not high, the module updates the state of the cells according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is assigned the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is assigned the constant value 0 (off).
   - For all other cells `q[i]` where `i` is between 1 and 510, the value is assigned based on the XOR of the two neighboring cells `q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`.
4. The `genvar` loop is used to iterate over the cells from 1 to 510 and update their values accordingly.

This Verilog module correctly implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton with the given specification.'}
