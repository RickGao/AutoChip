{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key features are:

1. The module has one 512-bit output `q` that represents the current state of the cellular automaton.
2. The `load` input is used to initialize the state of the cellular automaton with the `data` input.
3. On every clock cycle, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton according to the Rule 90 logic:
   - The leftmost cell `q[0]` is assigned the value of the cell to its right `q[1]`.
   - The rightmost cell `q[511]` is always set to 0 (off) to represent the boundary condition.
   - For all other cells `q[i]`, the new state is computed as the XOR of the left and right neighbors `q[i-1] ^ q[i+1]`.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell cellular automaton operates correctly according to the Rule 90 specification.'}
