{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle.

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key features are:

1. The module has a 512-bit wide output `q` that represents the state of the cellular automaton.
2. The `load` input is used to initialize the state of the system with the 512-bit `data` input.
3. On each clock cycle, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton by applying the Rule 90 logic:
   - The leftmost cell `q[0]` is updated to the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The rightmost cell `q[511]` is always set to 0 (off) since the boundary condition is 0.
   - For all other cells `q[i]` where `1 <= i < 511`, the new state is computed as the XOR of the left and right neighbors (`q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`).

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton.'}
