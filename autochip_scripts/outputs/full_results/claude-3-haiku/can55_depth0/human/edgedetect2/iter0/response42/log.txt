The completed Verilog module detects the rising edge of each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`. The module uses a register `in_reg` to store the previous value of `in`, and then compares the current value of `in` with the previous value stored in `in_reg` to detect any edge transitions. The output `anyedge` is a vector of 8 bits, where each bit is set to 1 if a rising edge was detected on the corresponding bit in the input vector `in`.'}
