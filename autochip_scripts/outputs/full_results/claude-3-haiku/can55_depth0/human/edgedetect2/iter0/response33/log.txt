The completed Verilog module detects any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) on the 8-bit input vector `in` and sets the corresponding bit in the output vector `anyedge` in the cycle after the edge transition occurs.

The module uses a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input vector `in`. In each clock cycle, the current value of `in` is compared with the previous value stored in `in_prev` using the XOR operator (`^`). The result of this XOR operation is then assigned to the output vector `anyedge`, which will have a '1' in the bits where an edge transition has occurred.'}
