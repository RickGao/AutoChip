In this implementation, we maintain a previous input register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`. On each clock cycle, we update `in_prev` with the current value of `in`, and then compute the `anyedge` output by taking the bitwise XOR of the current `in` and the previous `in_prev`. This will set the corresponding bit in `anyedge` whenever there is a 0 to 1 transition in the corresponding bit of `in`.'}
