The corrected module detects the edge transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector `in` and sets the corresponding bit in the output `anyedge` the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.

The `in_delay` register is used to store the previous value of `in`, so that the current value can be compared to the previous value to detect any changes. The `anyedge` output is then computed by taking the XOR of the current and previous values of `in`, and then masking the result with `8'b11111111` to keep only the bits where a transition has occurred.'}
