The corrected Verilog code does the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev`.
   - Calculates the edge detection by taking the bitwise AND of `in` and the negation of `in_prev`. This will result in a `1` for each bit where the input has changed from `0` to `1`.
   - Assigns the result to the output `anyedge`.

This ensures that the output `anyedge` is set to `1` for the cycle after a `0` to `1` transition occurs on each bit of the input `in`.'}
