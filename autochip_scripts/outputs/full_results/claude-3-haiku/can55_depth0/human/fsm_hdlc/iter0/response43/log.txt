{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences specified in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (`err` output).

The module has the following states:
- `IDLE`: The initial state, where the FSM looks for the start of a sequence.
- `DISC`: The state where a bit needs to be discarded.
- `FLAG`: The state where a frame flag has been detected.
- `ERR`: The state where an error has been detected (7 or more consecutive 1s).

The module uses a counter (`count`) to keep track of the number of consecutive 1s seen. When the count reaches 5, the FSM transitions to the `DISC` state. When the count reaches 6, the FSM transitions to the `FLAG` state. If the count reaches 7 or more, the FSM transitions to the `ERR` state.

The output signals (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) are asserted for one clock cycle after the corresponding condition is met.

The module also handles the reset signal, which sets the FSM to the `IDLE` state and resets the count to 0.'}
