{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences you described:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag)
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (err)

The module has a reset input that sets the state machine to the `STATE_IDLE` state, which behaves as though the previous input was 0.

The state transitions are defined in the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block, where the state machine moves from one state to the next based on the current state and the input value `in`.

The output logic is defined in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, where the `disc`, `flag`, and `err` outputs are set based on the current state of the state machine.'}
