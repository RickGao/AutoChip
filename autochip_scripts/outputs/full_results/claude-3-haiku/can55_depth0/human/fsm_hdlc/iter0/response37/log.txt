{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences specified in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc`)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag`)
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more consecutive 1s) (`err`)

The module has four states: `IDLE`, `DETECT_FIVE`, `DETECT_SIX`, and `DETECT_SEVEN`. The state transitions and output logic are designed to detect the required patterns and assert the corresponding output signals.

When the reset signal is active, the state machine is reset to the `IDLE` state, which behaves as if the previous input was 0.

The output signals (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) are asserted for a complete cycle, starting on the clock cycle after the corresponding condition is detected.'}
