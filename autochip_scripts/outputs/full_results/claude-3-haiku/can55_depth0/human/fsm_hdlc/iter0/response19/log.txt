{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets).

To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

The Verilog module provided above implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences specified in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

The module has the following key features:

1. The state transitions are handled in the `always` block for `next_state` logic, which updates the state on the positive edge of the clock based on the current state and the input `in`.
2. The output logic (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) is handled in a separate `always` block, which updates the output signals based on the current state and the reset signal.
3. The module initializes to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` signal is asserted.
4. The output signals are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.

This module should correctly handle the given HDLC framing requirements and provide the appropriate output signals.'}
