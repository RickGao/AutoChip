{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

The provided Verilog module is a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (`err` output).

The module has the following states:
- `WAIT`: Waiting for input.
- `DISC`: Discarding a bit.
- `FLAG`: Flagging the beginning/end of a frame.
- `ERR`: Signaling an error.

The module uses a `next_state` variable to keep track of the next state based on the current input and state. The `disc`, `flag`, and `err` outputs are set accordingly in the `case` statement.

The reset signal is handled in the `always` block, where the state is set to `WAIT` when `reset` is high. The module also ensures that the output signals are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.'}
