The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The module has a synchronous reset that should reset the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has the required input ports `clk`, `reset`, and output port `q`.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or the positive edge of `reset`.
3. When `reset` is high, the LFSR is reset to the initial state `5'b00001`.
4. When `reset` is low, the next state of the LFSR is computed by XORing the current value of bit 0 (the output bit) with the value of bit 2, and this result is assigned to the most significant bit `q[4]`. The remaining bits `q[3:0]` are shifted one position to the left.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR is a maximum-length LFSR with the required tap positions and the synchronous reset functionality.'}
