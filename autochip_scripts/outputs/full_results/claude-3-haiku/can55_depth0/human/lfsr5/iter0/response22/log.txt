The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should be a maximum-length LFSR, meaning it should cycle through 2^5-1 = 31 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). The active-high synchronous reset should reset the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implements the specified LFSR. The key points are:

1. The LFSR state is stored in the 5-bit register `q`.
2. On reset, the LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001`, which is the non-zero starting state.
3. On every clock cycle, the next state of the LFSR is computed by:
   - XORing the bits at tap positions 5 and 3 (`q[3] ^ q[0]`) to produce the new MSB.
   - Shifting the register one position to the right, effectively shifting in the new MSB.

This implementation ensures the LFSR is a maximum-length LFSR and resets to the correct non-zero state when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
