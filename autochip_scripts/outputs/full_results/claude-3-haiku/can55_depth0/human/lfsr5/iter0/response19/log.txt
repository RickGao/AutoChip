The completed Verilog module for the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, and a synchronous reset that resets the LFSR output to 1, is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` that is a 5-bit register to hold the LFSR output.
2. The module uses a register `next_q` to hold the next state of the LFSR.
3. The first `always` block updates the LFSR output `q` on the positive edge of the clock. If `reset` is high, it sets `q` to the value `5'b00001`. Otherwise, it assigns the value of `next_q` to `q`.
4. The second `always` block, which is a combinational logic block, computes the next state of the LFSR. It sets the most significant bit `next_q[4]` to the XOR of the least significant bit `q[0]` and the bit at position 3 `q[2]`, which corresponds to the taps at positions 5 and 3. The remaining bits `next_q[3:0]` are set to the shifted values of the current state `q[3:0]`.

This implementation ensures that the LFSR cycles through the maximum-length sequence of 2^5 - 1 = 31 states before repeating, and the synchronous reset sets the LFSR output to 1.'}
