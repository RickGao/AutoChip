The provided Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The module has the following features:

1. The `clk` input is the clock signal that triggers the LFSR update.
2. The `reset` input is the active-high synchronous reset signal that resets the LFSR output to 1.
3. The `q` output is a 5-bit wide signal that represents the current state of the LFSR.
4. In the `always` block, the LFSR is updated on the positive edge of the clock:
   - If `reset` is high, the LFSR output is set to 5'b00001 (resets to 1).
   - Otherwise, the LFSR is shifted by one bit, with the new least significant bit (`q[0]`) being the XOR of the previous most significant bit (`q[4]`) and the bit at position 2 (`q[2]`).

This 5-bit Galois LFSR will cycle through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
