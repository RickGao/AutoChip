The provided module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have a synchronous active-high reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implements this specification as follows:

1. The module has two always blocks:
   - The first always block handles the synchronous reset and updates the current state `q` to the next state `next_q` on each positive edge of the clock.
   - The second always block calculates the next state `next_q` based on the current state `q`. The bit at position 4 in `next_q` is the XOR of the bits at positions 0 and 2 in `q`, while the other bits in `next_q` are simply the bits shifted from the previous state in `q`.
2. When the `reset` input is high, the current state `q` is set to the value `5'b1`, which is the initial state for the maximal-length LFSR.
3. The output `q` represents the current state of the 5-bit LFSR.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with the required synchronous reset behavior.'}
