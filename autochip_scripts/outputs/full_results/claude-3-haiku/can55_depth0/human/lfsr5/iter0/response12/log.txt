The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have a synchronous active-high reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implements the required functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (synchronous reset).
2. The module has one output: `q` (a 5-bit register representing the LFSR state).
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or when the reset signal is high.
4. If the `reset` signal is high, the LFSR output `q` is initialized to `5'b00001`.
5. If the `reset` signal is low, the LFSR state is updated as follows:
   - The most significant bit `q[4]` is assigned the value of `q[3]`.
   - The bits `q[3]`, `q[2]`, and `q[1]` are shifted one position to the right.
   - The least significant bit `q[0]` is updated by XORing the values of `q[4]` and `q[2]`.
   - The bit `q[1]` is updated by XORing the values of `q[0]` and `q[2]`.

This implementation ensures that the LFSR produces a maximum-length sequence (2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states) before repeating, and that the LFSR output is reset to 1 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
