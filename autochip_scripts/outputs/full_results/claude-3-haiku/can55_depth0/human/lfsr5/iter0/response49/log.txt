The provided Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, and a synchronous active-high reset that sets the LFSR output to 1.

The key points are:

1. The `next_q` register holds the next state of the LFSR.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the `q` register with the next state from `next_q`.
3. The `always @(*)` block computes the next state `next_q` based on the current state `q`.
   - `next_q[4]` is set to the current least significant bit `q[0]`.
   - `next_q[3]` is set to the XOR of the fourth bit `q[4]` and the least significant bit `q[0]`.
   - The remaining bits `next_q[2:0]` are just shifted versions of the current state `q[4:1]`.
4. The reset condition sets the initial state of the LFSR to 5'b00001, which is a valid non-zero state.

This implementation ensures the LFSR will cycle through all 2^5 - 1 = 31 non-zero states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
