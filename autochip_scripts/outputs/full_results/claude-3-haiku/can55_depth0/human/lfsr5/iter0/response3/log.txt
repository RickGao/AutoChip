The provided Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The module has the following features:

1. The `clk` and `reset` inputs are used to control the operation of the LFSR.
2. The `q` output is a 5-bit register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
3. The `next_q` register is used to calculate the next state of the LFSR.
4. When the `reset` input is high, the LFSR is reset to the state `00001`, as specified in the problem statement.
5. On each positive edge of the `clk` input, the current state `q` is updated with the next state `next_q`.
6. The next state `next_q` is calculated by shifting the current state `q` one bit to the right, and XORing the least significant bit `q[0]` with the bit at position 2 `q[2]` to produce the new most significant bit `next_q[4]`.

This implementation ensures that the LFSR cycles through the maximum-length sequence of 2^5 - 1 = 31 states before repeating, as required by the problem statement.'}
