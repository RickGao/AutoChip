The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximum-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have a synchronous active-high reset that sets the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implements this functionality. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` to represent the 5-bit LFSR state.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, the module checks for the `reset` condition.
3. If `reset` is high, the module sets the initial state of the LFSR to `5'b00001`, which is the binary representation of 1.
4. If `reset` is not active, the module updates the LFSR state by shifting the current state left by one bit and XORing the most significant bit (`q[4]`) with the bit at position 2 (`q[2]`) to generate the new least significant bit.
5. This shifting and XORing implementation matches the Galois LFSR arrangement with taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the 5-bit maximum-length Galois LFSR with the required synchronous reset functionality.'}
