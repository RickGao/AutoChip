The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset the LFSR output to 1.

The completed Verilog module includes the following:

1. The `always` block that runs on the positive edge of the clock signal.
2. The `if` statement that checks for the `reset` input. When `reset` is high, the LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001`, which sets the output `q` to 1.
3. The logic that computes the next state of the LFSR. The new value of `q[4]` is the XOR of `q[3]` and `q[0]`, representing the taps at positions 5 and 3.
4. The shifting of the LFSR bits, where `q[3:0]` is assigned the values of `q[4:1]`.

This Verilog module implements the specified 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with the required reset behavior.'}
