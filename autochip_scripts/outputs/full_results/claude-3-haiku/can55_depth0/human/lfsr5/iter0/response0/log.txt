If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length".

The provided Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The `next_q` register calculates the next state of the LFSR based on the current state `q`. The synchronous reset sets the initial state to `5'b00001`. The module correctly implements the specified LFSR design.'}
