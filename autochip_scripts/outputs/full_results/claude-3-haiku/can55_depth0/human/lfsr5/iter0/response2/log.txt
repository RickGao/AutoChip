The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should be a maximum-length LFSR, which means it should cycle through 2^n-1 states (31 states in this case) before repeating.

The corrected Verilog module does the following:

1. Initializes the LFSR output `q` to `5'b00001` when the `reset` input is active high.
2. On each positive edge of the `clk` signal, the LFSR is updated as follows:
   - The new value of `q` is the current value of `q` shifted left by one bit.
   - The least significant bit of the new `q` is the XOR of the current values of `q[4]` and `q[2]`, which corresponds to the taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR is a maximum-length LFSR, cycling through all possible 31 non-zero states before repeating.'}
