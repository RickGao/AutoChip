The provided Verilog module specification is for a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have an active-high synchronous reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 5 bits to represent the LFSR state.

2. In the `always` block, the LFSR behavior is implemented:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the LFSR state `q` is set to 5'b00001, which is the reset state.
   - Otherwise, the LFSR state is updated:
     - The bits are shifted left by one position, effectively shifting the LFSR.
     - The new least significant bit `q[0]` is calculated as the XOR of the most significant bit `q[4]` and the bit at position 2 `q[2]`, which corresponds to the taps at positions 5 and 3.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR operates as a maximum-length LFSR, cycling through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, and the synchronous reset sets the LFSR output to the desired initial state of 1.'}
