The given problem description can be translated into Verilog code as follows:

1. For the sum-of-products form (`out_sop`), we need to generate a logic-1 output when the input conditions for 2, 7, or 15 are met. These conditions correspond to the following product terms:
   - `a & b & ~c & ~d` for 2
   - `~a & b & c & d` for 7
   - `a & b & c & d` for 15
   
   The `out_sop` output is assigned the logical OR of these three product terms.

2. For the product-of-sums form (`out_pos`), we need to generate a logic-1 output when the input conditions for 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14 are met. These conditions correspond to the following sum terms:
   - `~a | ~b | c | d` for 0, 1, 4, 5
   - `a | ~b | ~c | ~d` for 6, 9, 10, 13, 14
   
   The `out_pos` output is assigned the logical AND of these two sum terms.

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the specified digital system in both the sum-of-products and product-of-sums forms.'}
