The provided Verilog module specification describes a digital system with four inputs (a, b, c, d) that generates a logic-1 output when the input combination represents the numbers 2, 7, or 15, and a logic-0 output for the numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14. The input conditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 never occur in this system.

The Verilog module implementation provided above achieves the desired functionality. Let's go through the implementation:

1. The `out_sop` output is assigned the minimum sum-of-products form expression:
   - `(a & b & ~c & ~d)` represents the input combination for the number 2.
   - `(~a & b & c & d)` represents the input combination for the number 7.
   - `(a & b & c & d)` represents the input combination for the number 15.
   - The logical OR of these three terms yields the minimum sum-of-products form expression.

2. The `out_pos` output is assigned the minimum product-of-sums form expression:
   - `(~a | ~b)` represents the input combinations for the numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, and 13.
   - `(a | ~c)` represents the input combinations for the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12.
   - `(b | ~d)` represents the input combinations for the numbers 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, and 14.
   - The logical AND of these three terms yields the minimum product-of-sums form expression.

This Verilog module implementation correctly handles the given specification and provides the desired outputs in both minimum sum-of-products and minimum product-of-sums forms.'}
