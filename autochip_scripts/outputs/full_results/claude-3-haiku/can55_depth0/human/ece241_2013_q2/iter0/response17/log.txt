The provided Verilog module specification describes a digital system with four inputs (a, b, c, d) and two outputs (out_sop and out_pos). The system should generate a logic-1 output when the input combination corresponds to 2, 7, or 15, and a logic-0 output when the input combination corresponds to 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14.

The corrected Verilog module implementation is provided above, which includes the logic for both the Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms of the output.

The SOP form is implemented using a series of OR gates, where each term in the expression represents the input combination that should result in a logic-1 output.

The POS form is implemented using a series of AND gates, where each term in the expression represents the input combinations that should result in a logic-0 output. The final expression is then inverted to obtain the desired logic-1 output for the input combinations of 2, 7, and 15.'}
