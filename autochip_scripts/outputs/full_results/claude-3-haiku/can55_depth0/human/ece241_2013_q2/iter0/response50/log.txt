The provided Verilog module specification describes a digital system with four inputs (a, b, c, d) that generates a logic-1 output when the input combination corresponds to the decimal numbers 2, 7, or 15, and a logic-0 output for the decimal numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14. The input conditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 are never encountered.

The completed Verilog module provides the output expressions for the minimum sum-of-products (SOP) form and the minimum product-of-sums (POS) form.

For the minimum SOP form, the expression is:
```verilog
out_sop = (a & ~b & ~c & ~d) | (~a & b & ~c & ~d) | (a & b & c & d)
```
This expression covers the three input combinations that correspond to the decimal numbers 2, 7, and 15, which should generate a logic-1 output.

For the minimum POS form, the expression is:
```verilog
out_pos = (~a | ~b | c | d) & (a | ~b | ~c | d) & (~a | b | ~c | ~d)
```
This expression covers the complement of the input combinations that correspond to the decimal numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14, which should generate a logic-0 output.'}
