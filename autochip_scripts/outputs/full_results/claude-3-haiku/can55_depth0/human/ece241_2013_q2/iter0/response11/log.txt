The given problem describes a digital system with four inputs (a, b, c, d) that generates a logic-1 output when the input patterns correspond to the decimal numbers 2, 7, or 15, and a logic-0 output for the input patterns corresponding to the decimal numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14.

The Verilog module `top_module` implements the desired logic in both sum-of-products (SOP) form and product-of-sums (POS) form.

The SOP form is implemented using the `or` operator to combine the three minterms corresponding to the decimal numbers 2, 7, and 15. The POS form is implemented using the `and` operator to combine the three sum terms.

Both the `out_sop` and `out_pos` outputs are correctly implemented and should generate the desired logic-1 and logic-0 outputs based on the input patterns.'}
