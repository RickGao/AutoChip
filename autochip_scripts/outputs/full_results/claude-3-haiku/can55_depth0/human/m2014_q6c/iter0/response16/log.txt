The provided state machine description has been used to derive the next-state logic for the signals Y2 and Y4, corresponding to the state bits y[2] and y[4], respectively.

For the state bit y[2], which represents states B and C:
- When the current state is A (y[1] is 1) and the input w is 1, the next state is B (y[2] should be 1).
- When the current state is B (y[1] is 0) and the input w is 0, the next state is C (y[2] should be 1).

For the state bit y[4], which represents states D and E:
- When the current state is B (y[2] is 1) and the input w is 0, the next state is D (y[4] should be 1).
- When the current state is E (y[5] is 1) and the input w is 1, the next state is D (y[4] should be 1).

The Verilog code implements these next-state logic equations using the appropriate Boolean expressions.'}
