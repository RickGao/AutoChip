The provided Verilog code implements the next-state signals Y2 and Y4 corresponding to the state bits y[2] and y[4], respectively, based on the given state machine specification using one-hot encoding.

The logic equations for Y2 and Y4 are derived as follows:

Y2:
- From state A (y[1]), the next state is B (y[2]) when w = 0, so the term y[1] & ~w is included.
- From state B (y[2]), the next state is D (y[4]) when w = 1, so the term y[2] & w is included.
- From state C (y[3]), the next state is E (y[5]) when w = 0, so the term y[3] & ~w is included.
- From state E (y[5]), the next state is D (y[4]) when w = 1, so the term y[5] & w is included.

Y4:
- From state B (y[2]), the next state is C (y[3]) when w = 0, so the term y[2] & ~w is included.
- From state C (y[3]), the next state is D (y[4]) when w = 1, so the term y[3] & w is included.
- From state D (y[4]), the next state is F (y[6]) when w = 0, so the term y[4] & ~w is included.
- From state F (y[6]), the next state is D (y[4]) when w = 1, so the term y[6] & w is included.

The Verilog code correctly implements the logic equations for Y2 and Y4 based on the given state machine specification.'}
