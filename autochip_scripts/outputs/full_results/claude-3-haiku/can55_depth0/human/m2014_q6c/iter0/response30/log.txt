```verilog

The logic for Y2 is derived as follows:
- State B (y[2]) transitions to state C (y[3]) on input 0, and to state D (y[4]) on input 1.
- The transition from B to C is represented as `y[2] & ~w`, and the transition from B to D is represented as `y[2] & w`.
- State D (y[4]) also transitions to state B (y[2]) on input 0.
- The transition from D to B is represented as `y[4] & ~w`.
- State F (y[6]) transitions to state D (y[4]) on input 1.
- The transition from F to D is represented as `y[6] & w`.

The logic for Y4 is derived as follows:
- State D (y[4]) transitions to state F (y[6]) on input 0, and to state A (y[1]) on input 1.
- The transition from D to F is represented as `y[4] & ~w`, and the transition from D to A is represented as `y[4] & w`.
- State B (y[2]), state C (y[3]), and state E (y[5]) all transition to state D (y[4]) on input 1.
- The transitions from B, C, and E to D are represented as `y[2] & w`, `y[3] & w`, and `y[5] & w`, respectively.'}
