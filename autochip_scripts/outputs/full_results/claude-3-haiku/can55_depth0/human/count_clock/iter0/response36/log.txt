The module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. Here's how it works:

1. The `reset` signal resets the clock to 12:00 AM and clears the `pm` signal.
2. The `ena` signal is used to increment the clock. On each `ena` pulse:
   - The seconds counter (`ss`) is incremented, wrapping around to 0 when it reaches 59.
   - When the seconds counter reaches 59, the minutes counter (`mm`) is incremented, wrapping around to 0 when it reaches 59.
   - When the minutes counter reaches 59, the hours counter (`hh`) is incremented, wrapping around to 1 when it reaches 12. The `pm` signal is also toggled when the hours counter reaches 12.
3. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs are BCD-encoded two-digit values, and the `pm` output is 0 for AM and 1 for PM.'}
