The Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. It uses three 8-bit registers to store the hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively. The `pm` signal is used to indicate whether the clock is in the PM (1) or AM (0) period.

The module updates the clock on the positive edge of the `clk` input, and the `ena` signal is used to enable the clock increment. When `reset` is asserted, the clock is reset to `12:00 AM`.

The logic for incrementing the clock is as follows:
1. Increment the seconds, and if it reaches 59, reset it to 0 and increment the minutes.
2. Increment the minutes, and if it reaches 59, reset it to 0 and increment the hours.
3. Increment the hours, and if it reaches 12, reset it to 1 and toggle the `pm` signal.

The hours, minutes, and seconds are stored in BCD format, as specified in the problem statement.'}
