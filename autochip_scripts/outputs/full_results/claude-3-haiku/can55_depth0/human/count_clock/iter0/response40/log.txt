The module above implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. Here's how it works:

1. The `reset` signal, when high, sets the clock to "12:00 AM" and clears the `pm` flag.
2. On each positive edge of the `clk` signal, if the `ena` signal is high, the module increments the seconds counter (`ss`). When the seconds reach 59, the minutes counter (`mm`) is incremented, and when the minutes reach 59, the hours counter (`hh`) is incremented.
3. The hours counter wraps around from 12 to 1, and the `pm` flag is toggled when the hours reach 11 (to indicate the transition from AM to PM).

The BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) representation is used for the hours, minutes, and seconds outputs.'}
