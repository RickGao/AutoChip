The given Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The module has the following features:

1. The clock is clocked by a fast-running `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal is used to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second).
2. The `reset` signal is a synchronous active-high signal that resets the clock to "12:00 AM".
3. The `pm` output signal is used to indicate whether the current time is AM (0) or PM (1).
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the current time in BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) format, with `hh` ranging from 01 to 12, `mm` and `ss` ranging from 00 to 59.
5. The module correctly handles the rollover from 59 seconds to 00 seconds, 59 minutes to 00 minutes, and 12 AM to 01 PM (and vice versa).

This module should correctly implement the required 12-hour clock functionality.'}
