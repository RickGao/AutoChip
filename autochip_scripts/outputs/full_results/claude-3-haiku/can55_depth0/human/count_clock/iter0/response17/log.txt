This module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. It has the following features:

1. The clock is driven by a fast-running `clk` signal, with a pulse on `ena` to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second).
2. The `reset` signal has the highest priority and resets the clock to "12:00 AM" when asserted.
3. The `pm` output is asserted when the clock is in PM mode, and deasserted when it's in AM mode.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format, respectively.

The module uses a series of conditional statements to update the hours, minutes, and seconds based on the `ena` signal. The `reset` signal takes precedence and resets the clock to the starting state of "12:00 AM".'}
