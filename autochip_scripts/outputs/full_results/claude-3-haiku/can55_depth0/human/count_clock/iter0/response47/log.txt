The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator using BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digits for hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock is clocked by a fast-running `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal is used to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second).

The module has the following functionality:

1. On `reset`, the clock is set to "12:00 AM" (hours = 12, minutes = 0, seconds = 0, and `pm` is set to 0).
2. On each `ena` pulse (once per second), the seconds counter is incremented. When the seconds counter reaches 60, the minutes counter is incremented, and when the minutes counter reaches 60, the hours counter is incremented.
3. When the hours counter reaches 13, it is reset to 1, and the `pm` signal is toggled to indicate AM or PM.

The module uses BCD encoding for the hours, minutes, and seconds counters, and the output signals `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` are 8-bit wide to accommodate the BCD format.'}
