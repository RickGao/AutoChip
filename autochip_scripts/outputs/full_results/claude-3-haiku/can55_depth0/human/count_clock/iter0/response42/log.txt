The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The module has the following features:

1. The clock is initialized to 12:00 AM in the `initial` block.
2. The `reset` signal has the highest priority and can reset the clock to 12:00 AM at any time.
3. The `ena` signal is used to increment the clock. When `ena` is high:
   - The seconds are incremented, and when they reach 59, the minutes are incremented.
   - The minutes are incremented, and when they reach 59, the hours are incremented.
   - The hours are incremented, and when they reach 12, the AM/PM indicator is toggled.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs are BCD-encoded for the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59), respectively.
5. The `pm` output is high when the clock is in PM mode, and low when it's in AM mode.

This module should correctly implement the specified 12-hour clock functionality.'}
