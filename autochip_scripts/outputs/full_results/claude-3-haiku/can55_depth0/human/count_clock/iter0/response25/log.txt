The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The clock is clocked by the `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal is used to increment the clock by one second. The `reset` signal is used to reset the clock to "12:00 AM".

The module updates the `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` registers to keep track of the current time, and the `pm` register to indicate whether the current time is AM or PM.

The module correctly handles the rollover of seconds to minutes, minutes to hours, and hours from 12 AM to 12 PM.'}
