The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. The module has the following features:

1. The clock is clocked by the `clk` signal and increments on the `ena` signal, which is assumed to be a pulse occurring once per second.
2. The `reset` signal is a synchronous active-high reset that sets the clock to "12:00 AM".
3. The `pm` output signal is asserted when the clock is in the PM period and deasserted when the clock is in the AM period.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format, respectively.

The module uses a single `always` block to handle the clock logic. When the `reset` signal is asserted, the clock is set to "12:00 AM". When the `ena` signal is asserted, the seconds are incremented. If the seconds reach 59, the minutes are incremented, and if the minutes reach 59, the hours are incremented, and the AM/PM indicator is toggled when the hours reach 11.

The module correctly implements the 12-hour clock functionality as specified in the problem statement.'}
