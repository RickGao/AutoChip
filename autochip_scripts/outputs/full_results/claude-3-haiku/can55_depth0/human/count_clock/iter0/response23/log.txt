Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second, while "clk" is much faster than once per second). The signal "pm" is asserted if the clock is PM, or is otherwise AM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59).

The key aspects of the completed Verilog module are:

1. The module has the required input and output ports as per the specification.
2. It uses a 2-bit `am_pm` register to track the AM/PM state of the clock.
3. The `reset` signal has the highest priority and resets the clock to 12:00 AM.
4. The `ena` signal is used to increment the seconds, minutes, and hours as per the 12-hour clock logic.
5. The `pm` output is set based on the `am_pm` register.
6. The hours, minutes, and seconds are represented as 2-digit BCD values as required.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the 12-hour clock with AM/PM indication as per the given specification.'}
