The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with am/pm indicator. It uses three 8-bit registers to store the hours (hh), minutes (mm), and seconds (ss) in BCD format. The `pm` output signal is used to indicate whether the clock is in the PM (1) or AM (0) period.

The module has the following functionality:

1. The clock is reset to "12:00 AM" when the `reset` input is high.
2. When the `ena` input is high, the clock increments the seconds, minutes, and hours as follows:
   - Seconds are incremented from 00 to 59, and then reset to 00.
   - Minutes are incremented from 00 to 59, and then reset to 00.
   - Hours are incremented from 01 to 12, and the `pm` signal is toggled when the clock transitions from 12:00 PM to 12:00 AM.

The module ensures that the clock wraps around correctly and maintains the correct am/pm state.'}
