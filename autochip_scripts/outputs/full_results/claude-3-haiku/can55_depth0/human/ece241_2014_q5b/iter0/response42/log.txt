The Verilog module you provided is a correct implementation of the 2's complementer using a Mealy machine with one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has two states, `A` and `B`, represented using one-hot encoding with two bits.
2. The module resets to state `A` when the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high.
3. The state transitions are as follows:
   - From state `A`, if `x` is 0, the state remains in `A`. If `x` is 1, the state transitions to `B`.
   - From state `B`, if `x` is 0, the state remains in `B`. If `x` is 1, the state remains in `B`.
4. The output `z` is assigned based on the current state and the value of `x`, as per the given state diagram.

The Verilog code correctly implements the desired behavior of the 2's complementer Mealy machine.'}
