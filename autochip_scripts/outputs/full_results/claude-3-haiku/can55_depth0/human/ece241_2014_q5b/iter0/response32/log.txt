The provided Verilog module implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. It has four states: A, B, and a default state.
2. The module resets to state A on asynchronous active-high reset (areset).
3. The state transitions are as follows:
   - From state A, if x is 0, it stays in state A, and if x is 1, it transitions to state B.
   - From state B, if x is 0, it stays in state B, and if x is 1, it also stays in state B.
4. The output z is assigned based on the current state:
   - If the state is B, z is assigned the value of x.
   - If the state is not B, z is assigned the complement of x.'}
