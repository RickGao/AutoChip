The Verilog code above implements the Mealy machine 2's complementer as per the provided specification. The module has the following features:

1. It uses one-hot encoding for the states, with `STATE_A` represented as `2'b01` and `STATE_B` represented as `2'b10`.
2. The `next_state` logic is implemented in the combinational `always @(*)` block, where the next state and the output `z` are determined based on the current state and the input `x`.
3. The state register is updated in the synchronous `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block, where the state is reset to `STATE_A` when the asynchronous reset `areset` is high.

This implementation correctly captures the Mealy machine behavior as specified in the diagram.'}
