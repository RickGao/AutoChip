The Verilog code above implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has two states: A and B, represented using a 2-bit state variable.
2. The initial state is A, and the state transitions are based on the input `x` and the current state.
3. The output `z` is assigned based on the current state and input `x` according to the given state diagram.
4. The state transitions are synchronous with the clock, and the reset is asynchronous and active-high.

The `always` blocks handle the state updates and the next state logic. The `assign` statement generates the output `z` based on the current state and input `x`.'}
