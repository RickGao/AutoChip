The Verilog module implements the given Mealy machine specification using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The states are encoded using two-bit one-hot encoding, with `A` represented as `2'b01` and `B` represented as `2'b10`.
3. The `state` register stores the current state, and the `next_state` register stores the next state.
4. The `always` block for the `state` register updates the state on the positive edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high.
5. The `always` block for the `next_state` register computes the next state based on the current state and the input `x`.
6. The `z` output is assigned based on the current state and the input `x`, according to the specification.'}
