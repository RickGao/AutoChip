The provided Verilog module is a correct implementation of the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. It handles the specified state transitions and outputs the correct value of `z` based on the current state and input `x`.

The module uses two state variables, `state` and `next_state`, to represent the current and next states, respectively. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal, or when the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high.

The combinational logic in the `always @(*)` block determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`. The output `z` is assigned the appropriate value based on the current state and input `x`.

This implementation correctly matches the given state diagram and functional requirements.'}
