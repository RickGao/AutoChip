This Verilog code implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The state of the machine is represented using two-bit one-hot encoding, with states `A` and `B`.
3. The `state` register holds the current state, and `next_state` holds the next state.
4. The `always` block for the state update synchronously updates the `state` register on the positive edge of `clk`, or asynchronously resets the state to `A` on `areset`.
5. The `always` block for the next state and output logic combinatorially determines the next state and output `z` based on the current state and the input `x`.
6. In state `A`, if `x` is 0, the next state remains `A` and `z` is 0. If `x` is 1, the next state becomes `B` and `z` is 1.
7. In state `B`, the next state remains `B` and `z` is the complement of `x`.
8. The default case sets the next state to `A` and `z` to 0.'}
