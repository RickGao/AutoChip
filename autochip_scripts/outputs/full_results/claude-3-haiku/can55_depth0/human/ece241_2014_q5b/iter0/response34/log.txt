The Verilog module above implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The states are encoded using one-hot encoding, with `A` represented as `2'b01` and `B` represented as `2'b10`.
3. The state register `state` is updated on the positive edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset `areset` is high.
4. The state transitions are implemented using a case statement:
   - If the current state is `A` and `x` is 0, the next state is `A`.
   - If the current state is `A` and `x` is 1, the next state is `B`.
   - If the current state is `B` and `x` is 0, the next state is `B`.
   - If the current state is `B` and `x` is 1, the next state is `B`.
5. The output `z` is assigned based on the current state and the input `x`:
   - If the current state is `B`, `z` is assigned the value of `x`.
   - If the current state is `A`, `z` is assigned the negated value of `x`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding and the specified state transitions.'}
