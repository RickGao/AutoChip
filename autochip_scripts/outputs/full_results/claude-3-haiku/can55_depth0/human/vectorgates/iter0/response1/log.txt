The module correctly computes the bitwise-OR of the two 3-bit inputs `a` and `b` and stores the result in `out_or_bitwise`. It also computes the logical-OR of the two inputs and stores the result in `out_or_logical`. Finally, it computes the inverse (NOT) of both `a` and `b` and places the inverse of `b` in the upper half of `out_not` and the inverse of `a` in the lower half.'}
