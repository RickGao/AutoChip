endmodule
```

The provided Karnaugh map indicates that the output `out` should be 1 whenever:
1. `a` is 0 and `b` is 1
2. `a` is 1 and `b` is 0
3. `b` is 1 and `c` is 1
4. `a` is 0, `b` is 0, and `c` is 1

The Verilog code implements this logic using the Boolean expression:
`(a & ~b) | (~a & b) | (b & c) | (~a & ~b & c)`

This expression covers all the required conditions from the Karnaugh map and produces the desired output.'}
