The Verilog code above implements the Moore state machine as per the given specification. The state machine has two states, `A` and `B`, where `B` is the reset state. The reset is active-high synchronous.

The state transitions and output assignments are as follows:

- When in state `B` and `in` is 0, the state transitions to `A` and the output `out` is 1.
- When in state `B` and `in` is 1, the state remains in `B` and the output `out` is 1.
- When in state `A` and `in` is 0, the state transitions to `B` and the output `out` is 0.
- When in state `A` and `in` is 1, the state remains in `A` and the output `out` is 0.
- Upon reset, the state is set to `B` and the output `out` is set to 1.

The code uses a `case` statement to handle the state transitions and output assignments based on the current state and the input `in`.'}
