This Verilog module implements the Moore state machine as specified. The module has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `in` (the input signal), and `reset` (the synchronous active-high reset signal). The module has one output: `out`, which represents the output of the state machine.

The module defines two states: `STATE_B` and `STATE_A`, represented by the `state` register. The `always` block handles the state transitions and output generation based on the current state and the input signal `in`.

When the `reset` signal is high, the state is set to `STATE_B`, which is the reset state. In this state, the output `out` is set to 1.

If the state is `STATE_B`, and the input `in` is 0, the state transitions to `STATE_A`, and the output `out` remains at 1. If the input `in` is 1, the state remains in `STATE_B`, and the output `out` is 1.

If the state is `STATE_A`, and the input `in` is 0, the state transitions to `STATE_B`, and the output `out` is set to 0. If the input `in` is 1, the state remains in `STATE_A`, and the output `out` is 0.

The default case in the `case` statement handles any undefined states, resetting the state to `STATE_B`.'}
