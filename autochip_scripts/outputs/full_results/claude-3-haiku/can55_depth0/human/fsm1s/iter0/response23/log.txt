This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine specification. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in`, and `reset`, and one output `out`. The state machine has two states, `A` and `B`, represented by the `current_state` and `next_state` registers.

The `always` block for the state update logic checks the `reset` signal and updates the `current_state` register accordingly. If `reset` is high, the `current_state` is set to `B`, which is the reset state.

The `always` block for the next state and output logic uses a `case` statement to determine the next state and the output value based on the current state and the `in` input. The transitions between the states and the output values match the given specification.'}
