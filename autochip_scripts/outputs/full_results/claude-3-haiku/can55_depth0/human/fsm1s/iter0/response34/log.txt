This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine with two states, one input, and one output. The reset state is B, and reset is active-high synchronous.

The module has the following logic:

1. The state is stored in the `state` register, which can take two values: `A` and `B`.
2. The `out` output is determined by the current state: `out` is 1 when the state is `B`, and 0 when the state is `A`.
3. On each positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   - If `reset` is high, the state is set to `B` and `out` is set to 1.
   - If `reset` is low, the state is updated based on the current state and the value of `in`:
     - If the current state is `B`:
       - If `in` is 1, the state remains `B`.
       - If `in` is 0, the state transitions to `A`.
       - `out` is always set to 1.
     - If the current state is `A`:
       - If `in` is 1, the state remains `A`.
       - If `in` is 0, the state transitions to `B`.
       - `out` is always set to 0.'}
