The provided Verilog module correctly implements the specified n-bit shift register circuit. It includes a single stage of the shift register, consisting of a flip-flop and multiplexers. The module takes the following inputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: The value to be loaded
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting
- `L`: The load signal

The module updates the output `Q` based on the following logic:

1. If `L` is asserted, the value of `R` is loaded into the flip-flop.
2. If `E` is asserted, the value of `w` is shifted into the flip-flop.
3. If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the value of `Q` is retained.

This module can be used as a building block to construct an n-bit shift register circuit.'}
