The provided Verilog module `top_module` represents a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. It includes the necessary inputs and output, and the required functionality is implemented in the `always` block.

The module has the following inputs and output:
- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded.
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting.
- `L`: The signal to load the value `R` into the register.
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop.

The `always` block handles the following cases:
1. If `L` is high, the value of `R` is loaded into the flip-flop, and `Q` is updated.
2. If `E` is high, the value of `w` is shifted into the flip-flop, and `Q` is updated.

This module should correctly implement the n-bit shift register circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
