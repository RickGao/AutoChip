This Verilog module implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The inputs are:
- `clk`: The clock signal
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting
- `L`: The load signal

The output is:
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop in this stage of the shift register

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `L` signal is asserted, the flip-flop is loaded with the value of `R`. Otherwise, if the `E` signal is asserted, the flip-flop is loaded with the value of `w`, effectively shifting the data through the register.'}
