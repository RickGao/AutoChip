This Verilog module implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module takes the following inputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting.
- `L`: The load signal, indicating when the register should load the value from `R`.

The module outputs a single register `Q`, which represents the output of the current stage.

The module uses a `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The behavior of the module is as follows:

- If the load signal `L` is asserted, the register `Q` is loaded with the value from `R`.
- If the enable signal `E` is asserted, the register `Q` is updated with the input `w`.
- If neither `L` nor `E` are asserted, the register `Q` maintains its previous value.

This implementation ensures that the top_module correctly implements a single stage of the n-bit shift register circuit.'}
