The provided Verilog module specification represents a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the shift register
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting
- `L`: The signal to load the value `R` into the shift register

Output:
- `Q`: The output of the current stage of the shift register

The module implements the following logic:

1. When the `L` signal is asserted, the current stage's output `Q` is set to the value of `R`, effectively loading the shift register.
2. When the `E` signal is asserted, the current stage's output `Q` is set to the value of the multiplexer output `mux_out`.
3. The multiplexer selects between the input `w` (when `E` is asserted) and the current stage's output `Q` (when `E` is not asserted).

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified n-bit shift register circuit.'}
