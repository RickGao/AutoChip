The Verilog code above implements the signal Y1 and Y3 based on the state transition diagram provided.

For Y1:
- If the current state is A (y[0] is 1), then the next state is B (y[1] becomes 1).
- If the current state is B (y[1] is 1) and the current state is not C, D, E, or F (y[3], y[4], y[5] are 0), then the next state is D (y[1] remains 1).
- If the current state is C (y[3] is 1) and the current input is 1 (w is 1), then the next state is E (y[3] remains 1).

For Y3:
- If the current state is A (y[0] is 1), then the next state is D (y[3] becomes 1).
- If the current state is B (y[1] is 1) and the current state is not D, E, or F (y[3], y[4], y[5] are 0), then the next state is D (y[3] becomes 1).
- If the current state is C (y[3] is 1) and the current input is 0 (w is 0), then the next state is D (y[3] remains 1).
- If the current state is E (y[4] is 1) and the current input is 0 (w is 0), then the next state is D (y[3] becomes 1).'}
