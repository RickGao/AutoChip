The Verilog module provided above implements the given state machine description using one-hot encoding. The input `y` represents the current state, and `w` is the input signal.

The expression for `Y1` (the input of state flip-flop `y[1]`) is derived as follows:
- From the state machine diagram, the transitions to state `B` (represented by `y[1]`) are from states `A` (represented by `y[0]`) on input `w`, and from state `D` (represented by `y[3]`) on input `w`.
- The transitions to state `E` (represented by `y[5]`) are from state `F` (represented by `y[5]`) on input `~w`.
- Therefore, the Verilog expression for `Y1` is `(y[0] & w) | (y[1] & ~w) | (y[3] & w) | (y[5] & ~w)`.

The expression for `Y3` (the input of state flip-flop `y[3]`) is derived as follows:
- From the state machine diagram, the transitions to state `C` (represented by `y[2]`) are from state `B` (represented by `y[1]`) on input `w`.
- The transitions to state `D` (represented by `y[3]`) are from states `B` (represented by `y[1]`) on input `~w`, and from states `C` (represented by `y[2]`) and `F` (represented by `y[5]`) on input `~w`.
- Therefore, the Verilog expression for `Y3` is `(y[1] & w) | (y[2] & ~w) | (y[3] & ~w) | (y[5] & w)`.'}
