The provided Verilog code implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine with the following features:

1. The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. The next state logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which uses a `case` statement to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `in`.
3. The output logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which sets the output `out` to 1 when the state is D, and 0 otherwise.
4. The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the state is reset to A when the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high.

The implemented Verilog code should correctly implement the given state transition table and provide the desired behavior.'}
