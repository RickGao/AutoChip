The provided Verilog module specification describes a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:

1. The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. The state transitions are defined in the state transition table.
3. The output is 0 for states A, B, and C, and 1 for state D.
4. The state machine has a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The implemented Verilog module includes the following key components:

1. `localparam` definitions for the state encodings.
2. A `current_state` register to hold the current state, and a `next_state` register to hold the next state.
3. Combinational logic for the state transition function, implemented using a `case` statement.
4. Combinational logic for the output function, implemented using a ternary operator.
5. Sequential logic for the state register, with the asynchronous reset behavior.

The state machine correctly implements the given state transition table and output logic, and the asynchronous reset functionality is also included.'}
