The provided Verilog module implements the specified state machine with a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A. The module has the following components:

1. State and next state declarations: The module has two 2-bit registers `state` and `next_state` to represent the current and next states of the FSM.

2. State transition logic: The `always` block with the `(*)` sensitivity list defines the state transition logic based on the current state and the input `in`. The `case` statement updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the input value.

3. Output logic: The `out` output is set to 1 when the FSM is in state D, and 0 otherwise.

4. State register: The `always` block with the `posedge clk` and `posedge areset` sensitivity lists updates the `state` register to the `next_state` on the positive edge of the clock, and resets the state to A when the `areset` signal is high.

This implementation should correctly implement the specified state machine with the given state transition table and output logic.'}
