This Verilog module implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in`, and `areset`, and one output: `out`.

The state of the FSM is represented by the `state` register, which can take on four possible values: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The next state is determined by the current state and the input `in`, as specified in the state transition table.

The output `out` is determined by the current state of the FSM, where it is 1 when the FSM is in state `D`, and 0 otherwise.

The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the FSM is reset to state `A` when the `areset` input is asserted.'}
