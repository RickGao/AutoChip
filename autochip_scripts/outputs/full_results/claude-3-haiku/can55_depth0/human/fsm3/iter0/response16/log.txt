The provided Verilog module implements the specified state machine with a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The module has the following components:

1. State definitions: The four states are defined as parameters (A, B, C, D).
2. State register: The current state is stored in the `state` register, and the next state is stored in the `next_state` register.
3. Next state and output logic: The combinational logic for determining the next state and output is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, based on the current state and the input `in`.
4. State register update: The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, with the asynchronous reset taking precedence and resetting the state to A if `areset` is high.

The output `out` is assigned the appropriate value based on the current state, as specified in the state transition table.'}
