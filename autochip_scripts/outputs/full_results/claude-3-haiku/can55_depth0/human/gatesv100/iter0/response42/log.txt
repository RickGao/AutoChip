The provided Verilog module specification has been correctly implemented in the code above. The module takes a 100-bit input vector `in[99:0]` and generates three output vectors:

1. `out_both[98:0]`: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. The implementation uses the bitwise AND operation `&` to achieve this.

2. `out_any[99:1]`: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. The implementation uses the bitwise OR operation `|` to achieve this.

3. `out_different[99:0]`: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. The implementation handles the wrapping around case for the first bit `out_different[0]` by using the XOR operation `^` between `in[0]` and `in[99]`. For the remaining bits, the XOR operation is applied between each input bit and its left neighbour.

The code is well-formatted, and the logic for each output vector is correctly implemented.'}
