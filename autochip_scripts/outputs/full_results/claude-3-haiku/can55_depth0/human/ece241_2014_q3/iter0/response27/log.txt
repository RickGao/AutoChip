The Verilog code above implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and two 2-to-1 multiplexers.

1. The `mux_sel` signal is created by concatenating the `c` and `d` inputs.
2. The `mux_in[0]` output is set to 1 when `mux_sel` is 2'b00, and 0 otherwise.
3. The `mux_in[1]` output is set to 1 when `mux_sel` is 2'b01, and 0 otherwise.
4. The `mux_in[2]` output is set to 1 when `mux_sel` is 2'b11 or 2'b10, and 0 otherwise.
5. The `mux_in[3]` output is set to 1 when `mux_sel` is 2'b10 or 2'b00, and 0 otherwise.

This implementation uses the minimum number of multiplexers required to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
