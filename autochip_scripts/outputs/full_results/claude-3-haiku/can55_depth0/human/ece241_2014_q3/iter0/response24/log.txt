The key steps in this implementation are:

1. Use two 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement the Karnaugh map, with the first multiplexer handling the first two columns (ab = 00 and ab = 01) and the second multiplexer handling the last two columns (ab = 11 and ab = 10).
2. Connect the outputs of the two 2-to-1 multiplexers to the corresponding inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer, where the selector inputs are `a` and `b`.

This solution uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers (2) to implement the given Karnaugh map, and then combines their outputs into the 4-to-1 multiplexer as required.'}
