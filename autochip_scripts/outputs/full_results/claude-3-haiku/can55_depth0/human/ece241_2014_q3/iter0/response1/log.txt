The provided Karnaugh map can be implemented using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and two 2-to-1 multiplexers, as shown in the Verilog code above.

The key steps are:

1. Use NAND gates to implement the logic for the Karnaugh map entries.
2. Use a 2-to-1 multiplexer to select between the NAND gate outputs and constant values based on the input 'c'.
3. Use another 2-to-1 multiplexer to select between the output of the first multiplexer and a constant value based on the input 'd'.
4. Combine the outputs of the two 2-to-1 multiplexers to form the 4-bit `mux_in` output for the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

This implementation satisfies the constraints of using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and as few 2-to-1 multiplexers as possible to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
