The key steps in this implementation are:

1. Use two 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement the Karnaugh map. The first multiplexer selects between the minterms `(c & d)` and `(~c & d)` based on the value of `c`. The second multiplexer selects between the minterms `(c & ~d)` and `(c & d)` based on the value of `c`.

2. Connect the outputs of the two 2-to-1 multiplexers to the corresponding inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer. Since the Karnaugh map has only two '1' entries, we can connect the remaining two inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers (two) to implement the given Karnaugh map, and a single 4-to-1 multiplexer to select the final output based on the values of `a` and `b`.'}
