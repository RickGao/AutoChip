```

The key steps are:

1. Implement the Karnaugh map using multiplexers:
   - `m1` is the OR of `(c & ~d)` and `(~c & d)`, which corresponds to the first and fourth rows of the Karnaugh map.
   - `m2` is `(~c & ~d)`, which corresponds to the second row of the Karnaugh map.
   - `m3` is `(c & d)`, which corresponds to the third row of the Karnaugh map.
2. Assign the multiplexer inputs to the corresponding rows of the Karnaugh map:
   - `mux_in[0]` is `m1`
   - `mux_in[1]` is `m2`
   - `mux_in[2]` is `m3`
   - `mux_in[3]` is the OR of `(c & d)` and `(~c & d)`, which corresponds to the fourth row of the Karnaugh map.

This implementation uses one 4-to-1 multiplexer and three 2-to-1 multiplexers, which is the minimum required to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
