The Verilog code above implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and two 2-to-1 multiplexers. The key steps are:

1. Assign mux_in[0] = 1, since the Karnaugh map entry for ab=00 is 1.
2. Assign mux_in[1] = c, since the Karnaugh map entry for ab=01 is c.
3. Assign mux_in[2] = d ^ c, since the Karnaugh map entry for ab=11 is the XOR of c and d.
4. Assign mux_in[3] = d, since the Karnaugh map entry for ab=10 is d.

This implementation uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers required to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
