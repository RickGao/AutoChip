The completed Verilog module implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and two 2-to-1 multiplexers.

The logic is as follows:
1. The first two 2-to-1 multiplexers are used to generate the intermediate signals `t1` and `t2` based on the input variables `c` and `d`.
2. The second set of 2-to-1 multiplexers are used to generate the final outputs `t3` and `t4` based on the intermediate signals `t1` and `t2`.
3. The 4-to-1 multiplexer takes the final outputs `t3` and `t4` and connects them to the `mux_in` outputs, with the remaining two inputs set to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of multiplexers required to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
