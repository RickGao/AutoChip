The Verilog module `top_module` implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and three 2-to-1 multiplexers. The inputs `c` and `d` are used to generate the three intermediate signals `m1`, `m2`, and `m3`, which are then connected to the appropriate inputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

The logic expressions for `m1`, `m2`, and `m3` are derived directly from the Karnaugh map:

- `m1 = (c & d) | (~c & d)` implements the first row of the Karnaugh map.
- `m2 = (c & ~d) | (~c & d)` implements the second row of the Karnaugh map.
- `m3 = (c & d) | (~c & ~d) | (c & ~d)` implements the third and fourth rows of the Karnaugh map.

The 4-to-1 multiplexer inputs `mux_in[3:0]` are then assigned the appropriate values based on the Karnaugh map, with `mux_in[0]` being a constant 1 (corresponding to the "1" in the top-left corner of the Karnaugh map).'}
