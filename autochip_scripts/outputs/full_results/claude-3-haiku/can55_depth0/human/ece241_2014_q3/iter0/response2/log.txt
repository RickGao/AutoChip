The provided Karnaugh map can be implemented using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and three 2-to-1 multiplexers. The `top_module` implements the logic using the 2-to-1 multiplexers, with the outputs connected to the 4-to-1 multiplexer inputs.

For the ab=00 case, the output is always 1, so we can directly assign `ab_00 = 1`.
For the ab=01 case, the output is 1 when c=1, so we can assign `ab_01 = c`.
For the ab=11 and ab=10 cases, the output is 1 when c=1 or d=1, so we can assign `ab_11 = c | d` and `ab_10 = c | d`.

Finally, we connect the 2-to-1 mux outputs to the 4-to-1 mux inputs using the `mux_in` bus.'}
