The provided Verilog module is a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 1.

Here's how the module works:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
2. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 4'd1, which resets the counter to 1.
3. If the current value of `q` is 4'd10 (meaning the counter has reached 10), the value of `q` is set back to 4'd1, effectively wrapping around to 1.
4. If the counter has not reached 10 yet, the value of `q` is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures the counter counts from 1 to 10, inclusive, and resets to 1 when the `reset` input is high.'}
