The completed Verilog module for a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 inclusive, with a synchronous reset to 1, is provided above. The key aspects are:

1. The `q` output is declared as a 4-bit register to represent the range from 1 to 10.
2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is set to 1 (`4'b0001`).
4. If the `reset` signal is low, the counter is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle, until it reaches 10 (`4'b1010`), at which point it is reset to 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 1 to 10, inclusive, and resets to 1 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
