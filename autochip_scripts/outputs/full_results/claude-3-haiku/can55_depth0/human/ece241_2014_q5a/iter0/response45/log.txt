The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The key points of the corrected module are:

1. Declared the state parameter and state register.
2. Initialized the state, num, comp, and z registers in the reset condition.
3. Implemented the state machine logic in the `case` statement.
   - In the `IDLE` state, transition to `CONVERT` state when reset is released.
   - In the `CONVERT` state, shift the input bit `x` into the `num` and `comp` registers.
   - Set the output `z` based on the most significant bit of the `comp` register.
4. Registered the output `z` to ensure correct timing.

The module now correctly implements the serial 2's complementer Moore state machine as per the given specification.'}
