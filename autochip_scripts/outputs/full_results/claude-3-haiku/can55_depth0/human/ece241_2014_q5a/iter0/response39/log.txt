The provided Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that computes the 2's complement of an arbitrary-length binary input. The module has the following features:

1. It defines a state machine with three states: IDLE, COMPUTE, and COMPLETE.
2. The `num` register holds the input number, which is built up one bit at a time as the input `x` is shifted in.
3. The `result` register holds the 2's complement of the input number, which is also built up one bit at a time.
4. The `z` output is set to the most significant bit of the `result` register when the machine reaches the COMPLETE state.
5. The state machine starts in the IDLE state and transitions to the COMPUTE state when the input `x` is 1. It remains in the COMPUTE state until the entire input number has been shifted in (when `num` reaches 255), at which point it transitions to the COMPLETE state.
6. The circuit is reset asynchronously when the `areset` input is high.

This module should correctly implement the desired 2's complementer functionality.'}
