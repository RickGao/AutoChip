This Verilog module implements a one-input, one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits, one per clock cycle, representing the number to be converted. The output `z` is the 2's complement of the input number.

The module has two main states:
1. `IDLE`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the reset signal `areset` to be deasserted. In this state, the output `z` is set to 0.
2. `COMPUTE`: This is the state where the 2's complement conversion takes place. In this state, the input bits `x` are shifted into the `sum` register, and the 2's complement of the accumulated value is calculated and assigned to the output `z`.

The module uses an asynchronous reset signal `areset` to transition back to the `IDLE` state when the reset is asserted.'}
