The key points in the corrected Verilog code are:

1. Declared two 8-bit registers `count` and `twos_complement` to keep track of the input bit count and the 2's complement computation, respectively.
2. In the `always` block, the `count` is incremented on every clock cycle to keep track of the input bits.
3. The `twos_complement` register is updated by left-shifting and ORing the current input bit `x`.
4. When the `count` reaches 8 (indicating the completion of the 8-bit input), the final 2's complement is computed by negating `twos_complement` and adding 1. This result is then assigned to the output `z`.
5. The `count` and `twos_complement` are reset to 0 after the computation is complete, and `z` is set to 0 until the next computation.
6. The asynchronous reset `areset` is handled properly, resetting all the internal state variables and the output `z`.'}
