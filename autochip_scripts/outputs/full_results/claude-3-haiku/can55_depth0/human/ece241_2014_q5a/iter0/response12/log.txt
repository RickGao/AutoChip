The completed Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine accepts input numbers of arbitrary length and uses a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset.

The module has three states:
1. `IDLE`: The initial state, where the machine waits for the input to start.
2. `COMPUTE`: The state where the input bits are shifted into the `num` register, and the 2's complement is computed in the `neg_num` register.
3. `DONE`: The state where the least-significant bit of the 2's complement is output.

The state transitions are handled in the `always @(*)` block, and the state updates, input shifting, and output generation are handled in the `always @(posedge clk, posedge areset)` block.'}
