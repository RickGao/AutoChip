The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `z` output as a `reg` type.
2. Initialized the state, `num`, and `neg_num` registers in the asynchronous reset block.
3. Correctly updated the `num` register by shifting the input `x` into the least-significant bit.
4. Implemented the 2's complement logic in the combinational logic block, where the `neg_num` register is assigned the 2's complement of the `num` register, and the `z` output is assigned the least-significant bit of `neg_num`.
5. Handled the default case in the combinational logic block to ensure the output is 0 and the state is reset to S0.

The corrected module should now correctly implement the one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine.'}
