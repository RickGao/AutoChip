The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The module correctly implements a serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. It takes in a series of bits (one per clock cycle) and outputs the 2's complement of the input. The machine has three main states:

1. `8'b0`: Computes the 2's complement of the input bits as they are received. Toggles the LSB of the complement based on the input bit.
2. `8'd1`: Computes the final 2's complement by inverting all the bits and adding 1.
3. `8'd2` and subsequent states: Shifts out the 2's complement one bit at a time, starting from the LSB.

The module also handles the asynchronous reset correctly, resetting the state and complement values to 0 when `areset` is high.'}
