The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Defined the necessary states for the Moore state machine: `STATE_RESET` and `STATE_COMPUTE`.
2. Included the necessary registers to store the current state, the result of the 2's complement, and the count of input bits.
3. Implemented the state machine logic in the `always` block, which handles the asynchronous reset and the state transitions between `STATE_RESET` and `STATE_COMPUTE`.
4. In the `STATE_COMPUTE` state, the module shifts the result register to the left and stores the current input bit `x` in the least significant bit. The count is incremented until it reaches 7, at which point the 2's complement result is ready to be output.
5. The output `z` is assigned the negation of the most significant bit of the result register when the computation is complete (i.e., when the count reaches 7).'}
