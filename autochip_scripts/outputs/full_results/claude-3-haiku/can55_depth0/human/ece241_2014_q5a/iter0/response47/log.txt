The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The corrected Verilog module for the one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine is provided above. The key changes are:

1. Declared the `state` and `next_state` registers to handle the state transitions.
2. Initialized the `state` to `S0` on reset.
3. Shifted the input `x` into the `num` register on every clock cycle.
4. Calculated the 2's complement of `num` and stored it in `neg_num` in the `S0` state.
5. Drove the output `z` with the least significant bit of `neg_num` and right-shifted `neg_num` in the `S1` state.

With these changes, the module should correctly perform the 2's complement conversion on the input bit stream.'}
