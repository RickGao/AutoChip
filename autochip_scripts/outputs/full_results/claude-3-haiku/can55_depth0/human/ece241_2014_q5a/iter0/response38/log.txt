The module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.

The module has the following key components:
1. `count`: An 8-bit register to keep track of the current bit position in the input.
2. `complement`: An 8-bit register to store the intermediate 2's complement value.
3. `state`: A variable to keep track of the current state of the state machine.

The state machine has two states:
1. `Reset state`: This state is entered when the asynchronous reset `areset` is asserted. In this state, the module resets the `count`, `complement`, and `state` variables.
2. `Compute 2's complement`: This state is entered when the asynchronous reset `areset` is released. In this state, the module computes the 2's complement of the input `x` bit-by-bit, storing the result in the `complement` register. When all 8 bits have been processed, the final 2's complement value is written to the output `z`.

The module uses a `case` statement to implement the state machine logic. The state transitions and the computations performed in each state are as follows:

- In the `Reset state`, the module waits for the asynchronous reset `areset` to be released, then transitions to the `Compute 2's complement` state.
- In the `Compute 2's complement` state, the module performs the following steps:
  - If `count` is 0, the `complement` register is reset to 0.
  - Otherwise, the `complement` register is shifted right by 1 bit, and the most significant bit is set based on the current input `x`.
  - If `count` reaches 7 (all 8 bits have been processed), the 2's complement value is written to the output `z`, and the state machine transitions back to the `Reset state`.
  - If `count` is less than 7, the `count` is incremented.

The module uses the asynchronous reset `areset` to reset the state machine and the output `z` when the reset is asserted.'}
