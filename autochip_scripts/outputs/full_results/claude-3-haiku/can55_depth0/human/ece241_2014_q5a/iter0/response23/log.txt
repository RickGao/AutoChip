This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine accepts input numbers of arbitrary length and has a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset.

The module has two states: `WAIT` and `COMP`. In the `WAIT` state, the module collects the input bits and stores them in the `input_reg` register. Once all 8 bits have been received, the module transitions to the `COMP` state.

In the `COMP` state, the module computes the 2's complement of the input by taking the bitwise complement of the `input_reg` and adding 1. The least-significant bit of the complement is then output as `z`, and the complement is shifted one bit to the right to prepare for the next bit. The bit count is decremented, and the module transitions back to the `WAIT` state when all 8 bits have been processed.

The module also handles the asynchronous reset signal `areset`, which resets the state machine, input register, and output to their initial values.'}
