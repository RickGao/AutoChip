The provided Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length.

The module has two states: `IDLE` and `COMPUTE`. When the reset signal `areset` is high, the module enters the `IDLE` state and initializes the necessary variables. When `areset` is low, the module transitions to the `COMPUTE` state, where it starts processing the input bits.

In the `COMPUTE` state, the module shifts the input bits into the `num` register and the complement bits into the `comp` register. The output `z` is set based on the current input bit. If the input bit is 1, `z` is set to 1, otherwise, it is set to 0.

The module continues to process the input bits until the reset signal `areset` is asserted, at which point it returns to the `IDLE` state and resets the necessary variables.'}
