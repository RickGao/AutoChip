The completed Verilog module implements a serial 2's complementer using a Moore state machine. The module has the following features:

1. It has a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset `areset`.
2. The conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.
3. The input `x` is a series of bits, one per clock cycle, starting from the least-significant bit.
4. The output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.
5. The module uses two states: `STATE_IDLE` and `STATE_COMPLEMENTING`.
6. In the `STATE_IDLE` state, the module waits for `areset` to be released to start the conversion.
7. In the `STATE_COMPLEMENTING` state, the module shifts the input bits into `input_reg`, complements the bits, and stores them in `complement_reg`. After 8 bits have been processed, the 2's complement is output on `z`.
8. The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the number of bits processed.

The module correctly implements the specified serial 2's complementer using a Moore state machine.'}
