This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The state machine has three states: IDLE, COMPUTE, and OUTPUT.

In the IDLE state, the machine waits for the input `x` to become high, indicating the start of the conversion. When `x` is high, the machine transitions to the COMPUTE state.

In the COMPUTE state, the machine shifts the input `x` into the `accumulator` register and toggles the `negate` flag to keep track of whether the final output should be negated or not.

When the conversion is complete (i.e., all input bits have been processed), the machine transitions to the OUTPUT state, where it outputs the 2's complement of the input value, based on the state of the `negate` flag.

The module also includes an asynchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine to the IDLE state when the `areset` signal is high.'}
