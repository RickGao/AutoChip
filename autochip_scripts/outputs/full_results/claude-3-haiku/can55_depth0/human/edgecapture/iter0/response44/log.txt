The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key aspects are:

1. Use a for loop to iterate through each bit of the 32-bit input `in` signal.
2. Check if the current bit of `in` is 1 and the corresponding bit of `out` is 0, indicating a rising edge. If so, set the corresponding bit of `out` to 1.
3. Check if the current bit of `in` is 0, and if so, set the corresponding bit of `out` to 0, effectively clearing the captured transition.
4. The synchronous reset signal `reset` is used to clear the entire `out` register when asserted.

This implementation correctly captures the desired behavior, where the output `out` remains 1 until the register is reset, whenever the input `in` changes from 1 to 0 in the previous clock cycle.'}
