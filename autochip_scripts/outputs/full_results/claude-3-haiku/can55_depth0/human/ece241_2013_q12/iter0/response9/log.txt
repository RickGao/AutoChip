{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

```

The key elements of this module are:

1. The 8-bit shift register implemented using a single `reg [7:0] shift_reg` variable and an `always` block that shifts the bits on the positive edge of the clock when the `enable` input is high.
2. The 3-input logic function implemented using a separate `always` block that uses a `case` statement to select the appropriate bit from the `shift_reg` based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, and assigns it to the `Z` output.

The module should function as described in the problem statement, providing "random access" to the 8 bits stored in the shift register based on the combination of `A`, `B`, and `C` inputs.'}
