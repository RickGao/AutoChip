{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided code implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous enable input and a multiplexer to select the output Z based on the input combination of A, B, and C.

The key features of the code are:

1. The 8-bit shift register is implemented using a single `reg [7:0] Q` variable, where the bits are shifted on the positive edge of the clock when the `enable` input is high.
2. The multiplexer logic is implemented using a `case` statement, where the output Z is assigned the corresponding bit of the shift register Q based on the input combination of A, B, and C.
3. The `default` case in the `case` statement handles invalid input combinations by setting the output Z to an unknown value (`1'bx`).

This circuit can be used to implement a 3-input logic function by programming the appropriate values into the shift register and selecting the desired output bit using the A, B, and C inputs.'}
