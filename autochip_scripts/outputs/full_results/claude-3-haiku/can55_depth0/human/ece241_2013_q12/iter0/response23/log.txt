This module implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous enable. The shift register's input `S` is shifted into the MSB of the register on each enabled clock cycle.

The module also includes a 3-to-8 decoder that generates a one-hot encoded output based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. The decoder output is then used to select the appropriate bit from the shift register to output to `Z`.

When `ABC` is 000, `Z` will be equal to `Q[0]`, when `ABC` is 001, `Z` will be equal to `Q[1]`, and so on, effectively realizing the 3-input logic function as specified in the problem statement.'}
