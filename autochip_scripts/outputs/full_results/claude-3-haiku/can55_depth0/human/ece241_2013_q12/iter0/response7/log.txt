{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The key components of this Verilog module are:

1. **8-bit Shift Register**: The module contains an 8-bit shift register implemented using a `reg [7:0] shift_reg` variable. The shift register is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` when the `enable` input is high, shifting in the `S` input into the MSB.

2. **3-to-8 Decoder**: The module includes a 3-to-8 decoder implemented using combinational logic to generate the 8 address bits `addr[7:0]` based on the `A`, `B`, and `C` inputs.

3. **Output Logic**: The output `Z` is assigned the value of the shift register element selected by the 3-bit address `A`, `B`, and `C`. This implements the desired functionality where `Z` is equal to `Q[0]` when `ABC` is `000`, `Q[1]` when `ABC` is `001`, and so on.

The module should correctly implement the specified 8x1 memory with shifting-in for writing and random access for reading, as well as the 3-input logic function.'}
