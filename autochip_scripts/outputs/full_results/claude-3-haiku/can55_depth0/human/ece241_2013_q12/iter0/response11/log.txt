You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

This Verilog module implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous active-high enable input, and a 3-to-8 decoder that selects the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the input ABC. The selected bit is then assigned to the output Z.

The shift register is implemented using a single `always` block that shifts the input S into the MSB of the register when the enable input is high. The 3-to-8 decoder is implemented using a set of combinational logic expressions that generate the appropriate decoder output based on the input ABC. Finally, the selected bit from the shift register is assigned to the output Z using a combinational logic expression that combines the shift register bits with the decoder outputs.'}
