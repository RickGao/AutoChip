The provided Verilog code implements the required functionality to recognize the four arrow key scancodes and assert the corresponding output signals. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has one 16-bit input `scancode` and four 1-bit outputs `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up`.
2. The `always` block is triggered on any change in the input `scancode`.
3. At the beginning of the block, all output signals are initialized to 0.
4. Then, a `case` statement is used to check the value of `scancode` and set the corresponding output signal to 1.
5. For the default case, where the `scancode` does not match any of the four arrow key scancodes, all outputs remain 0.

This Verilog module should correctly recognize the four arrow key scancodes and assert the corresponding output signals.'}
