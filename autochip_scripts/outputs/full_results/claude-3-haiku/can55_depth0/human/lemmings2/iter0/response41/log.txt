{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

The provided Verilog module implements the Lemmings game behavior as described. It uses a Moore state machine to model the Lemming's walking direction, which can be either walking left or walking right. The state transitions are determined based on the inputs `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`.

The key aspects of the module are:

1. Asynchronous reset: The `areset` input resets the Lemming machine to the "walk left" state.
2. Walking direction: The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs indicate the Lemming's current walking direction.
3. Falling behavior: When `ground` is 0, the `aaah` output is set to 1, indicating that the Lemming is falling.
4. State transitions: The next state is determined based on the current state and the input conditions. The Lemming will switch direction when bumped on the left or right side.

The module correctly implements the specified Lemmings game behavior.'}
