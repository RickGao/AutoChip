{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

This Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. The module has six inputs (clk, areset, bump_left, bump_right, ground) and three outputs (walk_left, walk_right, aaah).

The state machine has two states: STATE_WALK_LEFT and STATE_WALK_RIGHT. The initial state is STATE_WALK_LEFT, and the state is updated based on the input signals.

- If the Lemming is walking left and is bumped on the right (bump_right == 1), it switches to walking right (state <= STATE_WALK_RIGHT).
- If the Lemming is walking right and is bumped on the left (bump_left == 1), it switches to walking left (state <= STATE_WALK_LEFT).
- If the ground disappears (ground == 0), the Lemming falls and the aaah output is set to 1.
- When the ground reappears (ground == 1), the Lemming resumes walking in the same direction as before the fall.
- The asynchronous reset (areset) sets the state to STATE_WALK_LEFT, walk_left to 1, walk_right to 0, and aaah to 0.

The output signals walk_left, walk_right, and aaah are updated based on the current state and input signals.'}
