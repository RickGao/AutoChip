{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The key changes are:

1. The `done` output is now a registered signal that is set to 1 in the cycle immediately after the third byte of the message is received.
2. The `byte_count` variable keeps track of the current position in the 3-byte message.
3. The state machine transitions between `WAIT_FOR_FIRST`, `WAIT_FOR_SECOND`, and `WAIT_FOR_THIRD` states to detect the 3-byte message boundary.
4. The default case in the state machine resets the state and byte count, and clears the `done` signal.

This should provide the correct implementation of the PS/2 mouse protocol finite state machine.'}
