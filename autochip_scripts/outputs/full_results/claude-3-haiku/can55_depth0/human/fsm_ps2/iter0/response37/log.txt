{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) that searches for message boundaries in a continuous byte stream, specifically for the PS/2 mouse protocol. The module has the following behavior:

1. It starts in the `STATE_WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` state, waiting for a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a new message.
2. When a byte with `in[3]` set to 1 is received, the module transitions to the `STATE_RECEIVING_MESSAGE` state and starts counting the number of bytes received.
3. In the `STATE_RECEIVING_MESSAGE` state, the module continues to count the number of bytes received. Once the third byte is received (i.e., `byte_count` reaches 3), the module sets the `done` output to 1 and then transitions back to the `STATE_WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` state, waiting for the next message.
4. If more than three bytes are received without a valid message (i.e., `byte_count` exceeds 3), the module resets the `byte_count` to 0 and transitions back to the `STATE_WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` state, discarding the invalid bytes.
5. The `reset` input resets the module to the `STATE_WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` state and clears the `done` output.

This implementation should correctly handle the given PS/2 mouse protocol requirements.'}
