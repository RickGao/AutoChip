{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The module provided is a Verilog implementation of a finite state machine that searches for and processes PS/2 mouse protocol messages. It has the following features:

1. The module has three states: `STATE_WAIT`, `STATE_BYTE1`, `STATE_BYTE2`, and `STATE_BYTE3`.
2. The module waits for the first byte with `in[3] = 1`, which indicates the start of a message.
3. Once the first byte is received, the module proceeds to receive the second and third bytes.
4. After the third byte is received, the module sets the `done` output high to signal the completion of the message.
5. The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the module to the `STATE_WAIT` state.

The module correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement and should be able to process the PS/2 mouse protocol messages.'}
