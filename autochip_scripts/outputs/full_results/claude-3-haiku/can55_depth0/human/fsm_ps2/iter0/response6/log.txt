{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has four states: `WAIT_MSG`, `RECV_BYTE1`, `RECV_BYTE2`, and `RECV_BYTE3`.
2. The module starts in the `WAIT_MSG` state, waiting for the first byte of a message (where `in[3]` is 1).
3. Once the first byte is received, the module moves to the `RECV_BYTE1` state, and then sequentially to `RECV_BYTE2` and `RECV_BYTE3` states to receive the remaining two bytes of the message.
4. After receiving the third byte, the module sets the `done` output to 1 to signal the receipt of a complete message, and then returns to the `WAIT_MSG` state.
5. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the state machine to the `WAIT_MSG` state and clearing the `done` output.'}
