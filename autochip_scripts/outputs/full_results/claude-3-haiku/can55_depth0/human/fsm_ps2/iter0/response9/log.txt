{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The key changes made are:

1. Declared a `done` output as a `reg` to allow for proper assignment in the state machine.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, and `WAIT_THIRD`.
3. In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, checked if `in[3]` is high to transition to the `WAIT_SECOND` state.
4. In the `WAIT_SECOND` state, transitioned to the `WAIT_THIRD` state.
5. In the `WAIT_THIRD` state, set the `done` output high and transitioned back to the `WAIT_FIRST` state.
6. Handled the default case to ensure the state machine is in the `WAIT_FIRST` state and `done` is low.

This FSM implementation should correctly detect and signal the completion of each 3-byte message in the input stream.'}
