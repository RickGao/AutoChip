{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected module is as follows:

1. The `done` output is declared as a `reg` type to allow it to be updated in the `always` block.
2. The state machine has three states:
   - `STATE_WAIT_FOR_FIRST`: Waits for the first byte of the message (i.e., the byte with `in[3]` set to 1).
   - `STATE_RECEIVE_SECOND`: Receives the second byte of the message.
   - `STATE_RECEIVE_THIRD`: Receives the third byte of the message and sets the `done` output to 1 to indicate that a complete message has been received.
3. The `always` block updates the state and `done` output based on the current state and the value of `in[3]`.
4. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `STATE_WAIT_FOR_FIRST` and setting `done` to 0.

This implementation correctly handles the message boundaries according to the problem description.'}
