{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module provided is a finite state machine that searches for message boundaries in a continuous byte stream of PS/2 mouse protocol data. The algorithm implemented is as follows:

1. The module starts in the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state, waiting for the first byte of a message, which is indicated by `in[3] == 1`.
2. Once the first byte is received, the state transitions to `WAIT_FOR_SECOND`, where it waits for the second byte of the message.
3. After the second byte is received, the state transitions to `WAIT_FOR_THIRD`, where it waits for the third and final byte of the message.
4. When the third byte is received, the `done` signal is set to 1 to indicate that a complete message has been received, and the state transitions back to `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` to start looking for the next message.
5. The `reset` signal is implemented as a synchronous reset, which sets the state to `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` and clears the `done` signal.

This implementation should correctly identify the message boundaries in the input byte stream and signal the receipt of a complete message with the `done` output.'}
