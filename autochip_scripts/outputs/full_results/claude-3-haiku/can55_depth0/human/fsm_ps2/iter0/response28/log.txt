{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine that correctly implements the given specification for detecting the start and end of PS/2 mouse protocol messages. The module has the following key features:

1. The module has four states: `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, `WAIT_THIRD`, and `DONE`.
2. The `state` variable keeps track of the current state of the state machine.
3. The `byte_count` variable keeps track of the number of bytes received for the current message.
4. In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, the module waits for the first byte of the message, which is indicated by `in[3]` being `1`.
5. Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to the `WAIT_SECOND` state and increments the `byte_count`.
6. In the `WAIT_SECOND` state, the module waits for the second byte of the message, and once it is received, the module transitions to the `WAIT_THIRD` state and increments the `byte_count`.
7. In the `WAIT_THIRD` state, the module waits for the third byte of the message, and once it is received, the module transitions to the `DONE` state, sets the `done` output to `1`, and resets the `byte_count` to `0`.
8. In the `DONE` state, the `done` output is set to `0`, and the module transitions back to the `WAIT_FIRST` state, ready to detect the start of a new message.
9. The module also handles the `reset` input, which synchronously resets the state machine to the `WAIT_FIRST` state and sets the `done` output to `0`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the given specification and should work as expected.'}
