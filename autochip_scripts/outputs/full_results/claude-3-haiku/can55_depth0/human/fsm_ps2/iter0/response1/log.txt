{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:
1. Defined the state machine with four states: `WAIT_FOR_MSG`, `READ_MSG_1`, `READ_MSG_2`, and `READ_MSG_3`.
2. Implemented the state transition logic in the `always @(*)` block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the value of `in[3]`.
3. Asserted the `done` signal in the `READ_MSG_3` state, which indicates that the third byte of the message has been successfully received.
4. Handled the reset condition in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, where the state is reset to `WAIT_FOR_MSG` and the `done` signal is cleared.

This implementation correctly identifies the start of a new message by checking the value of `in[3]` and signals the completion of a message by asserting the `done` signal.'}
