{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module provided correctly implements the finite state machine to detect the start and end of PS/2 mouse protocol messages. The module has the following features:

1. It has three states: `WAIT_FOR_FIRST`, `WAIT_FOR_SECOND`, and `WAIT_FOR_THIRD`, corresponding to the three bytes of the message.
2. In the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state, it checks if the most significant bit (in[3]) of the input byte is 1, indicating the start of a new message. If it is, it transitions to the `WAIT_FOR_SECOND` state, otherwise it stays in the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state.
3. In the `WAIT_FOR_SECOND` state, it transitions to the `WAIT_FOR_THIRD` state, indicating that the second byte of the message has been received.
4. In the `WAIT_FOR_THIRD` state, it sets the `done` output to 1, indicating that the third byte of the message has been received, and then transitions back to the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state to wait for the next message.
5. The `reset` signal is handled correctly, resetting the state machine to the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state and setting the `done` output to 0.

This implementation should correctly detect the start and end of PS/2 mouse protocol messages given the input byte stream.'}
