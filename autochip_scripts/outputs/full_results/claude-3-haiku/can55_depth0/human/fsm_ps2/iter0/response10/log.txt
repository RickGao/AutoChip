{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The module implements a finite state machine that searches for the start of a PS/2 mouse protocol message and signals the receipt of a complete message.

The state machine has four states:
- `STATE_WAIT`: Waiting for the first byte of a message (i.e., a byte with in[3] = 1).
- `STATE_BYTE1`: The first byte of a message has been received.
- `STATE_BYTE2`: The second byte of a message has been received.
- `STATE_BYTE3`: The third byte of a message has been received.

The `byte_count` variable keeps track of the number of bytes received in the current message.

When the machine is in the `STATE_WAIT` state and a byte with in[3] = 1 is received, the state transitions to `STATE_BYTE1`, and `byte_count` is set to 1.

In the `STATE_BYTE1` state, if another byte with in[3] = 1 is received, the state transitions to `STATE_BYTE2`, and `byte_count` is incremented to 2. If a byte with in[3] = 0 is received, the state transitions back to `STATE_WAIT`, and `byte_count` is reset to 0.

In the `STATE_BYTE2` state, the state transitions to `STATE_BYTE3`, and `byte_count` is incremented to 3.

In the `STATE_BYTE3` state, the `done` signal is set to 1, indicating that a complete message has been received, and the state machine transitions back to `STATE_WAIT`, with `byte_count` reset to 0.

The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, resetting the state machine to the `STATE_WAIT` state and clearing the `done` signal and `byte_count` variable.'}
