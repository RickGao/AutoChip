{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine (FSM) that searches for message boundaries in a continuous byte stream from a PS/2 mouse protocol. The module has three states: `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, and `WAIT_THIRD`, which correspond to the three bytes of a message.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, the module waits for a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a new message.
2. When a byte with `in[3]` set to 1 is detected, the module transitions to the `WAIT_SECOND` state.
3. In the `WAIT_SECOND` state, the module expects the second byte of the message.
4. After receiving the second byte, the module transitions to the `WAIT_THIRD` state.
5. In the `WAIT_THIRD` state, the module expects the third byte of the message.
6. After receiving the third byte, the module sets the `done` output to 1 and transitions back to the `WAIT_FIRST` state, ready to detect the start of the next message.

The `reset` input is used to reset the module to the `WAIT_FIRST` state and clear the `done` output.'}
