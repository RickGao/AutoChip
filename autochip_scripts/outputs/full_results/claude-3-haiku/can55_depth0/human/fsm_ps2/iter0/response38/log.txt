{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The key changes made are:

1. Added a `reg done` output to signal the completion of a full message.
2. Defined the three states of the FSM: `WAIT_FOR_FIRST`, `WAIT_FOR_SECOND`, and `WAIT_FOR_THIRD`.
3. In the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state, we check if `in[3]` is 1 to indicate the start of a new message.
4. In the `WAIT_FOR_SECOND` state, we simply move to the `WAIT_FOR_THIRD` state.
5. In the `WAIT_FOR_THIRD` state, we set the `done` output to 1 and then move back to the `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state.
6. In the default case, we reset the state to `WAIT_FOR_FIRST` and the `done` output to 0.

This FSM should correctly identify the message boundaries in the input byte stream and signal the completion of each 3-byte message.'}
