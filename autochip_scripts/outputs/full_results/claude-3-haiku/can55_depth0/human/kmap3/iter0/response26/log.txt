The given Karnaugh map can be implemented using a case statement in Verilog. The case statement checks the combination of inputs `c` and `d` and assigns the appropriate value to the output `out` based on the Karnaugh map.

- When `c` and `d` are both 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of `a`.
- When `c` is 0 and `d` is 1, the output `out` is assigned 0.
- When `c` is 1 and `d` is either 1 or 0, the output `out` is assigned 1.
- When `c` is 1 and `d` is 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of `b`.
- The `default` case covers the don't-care condition and assigns 1 to the output `out`.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the circuit described by the given Karnaugh map.'}
