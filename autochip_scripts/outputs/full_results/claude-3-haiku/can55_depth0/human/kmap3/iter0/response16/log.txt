The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `always` block is used to implement the logic based on the given Karnaugh map.
2. The `case` statement is used to evaluate the inputs `c` and `d` and assign the appropriate value to the output `out`.
3. For the `00` case, the output `out` is set to the negation of `a`.
4. For the `01` case, the output `out` is set to 0.
5. For the `11` and `10` cases, the output `out` is set to 1.
6. The `default` case handles the don't-care condition, where the output `out` is set to 1.'}
