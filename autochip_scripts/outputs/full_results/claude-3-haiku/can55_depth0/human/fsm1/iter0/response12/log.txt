This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine. The states are represented by the `state` register, where `A` corresponds to state 0 and `B` corresponds to state 1.

The `always` block handles the state transitions and the output assignment. When `areset` is high, the state is set to `B` and the output `out` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state transitions are handled based on the current state and the input `in`.

The state machine follows the transition diagram provided:
- If the current state is `A` and the input `in` is 0, the next state is `B` and the output `out` is set to 1.
- If the current state is `A` and the input `in` is 1, the next state is `A` and the output `out` is set to 0.
- If the current state is `B` and the input `in` is 0, the next state is `A` and the output `out` is set to 0.
- If the current state is `B` and the input `in` is 1, the next state is `B` and the output `out` is set to 1.'}
