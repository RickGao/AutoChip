This Verilog code implements the Moore state machine described in the problem statement. The state machine has two states, A and B, with the following transitions:

- From state B, if the input `in` is 0, the next state is A and the output `out` is 0. If `in` is 1, the next state is B and the output `out` is 1.
- From state A, if the input `in` is 0, the next state is B and the output `out` is 1. If `in` is 1, the next state is A and the output `out` is 0.

The state machine is reset asynchronously to state B when the `areset` input is high, and the output `out` is set to 1 in this case.

The `always` block in the code handles the state transitions and output updates based on the current state and input `in`. The `case` statement is used to implement the state machine logic.'}
