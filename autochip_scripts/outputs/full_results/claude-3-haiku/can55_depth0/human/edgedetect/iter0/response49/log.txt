The provided Verilog module correctly implements the functionality of detecting a 0 to 1 transition on each bit of an 8-bit vector and setting the corresponding output bit the cycle after the transition occurs.

The key steps are:

1. Use a register `in_prev` to store the previous input value.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, update the `in_prev` register with the current input `in`.
3. Compute the output `pedge` by performing a bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the negated previous input `~in_prev`. This will set the output bit only when the corresponding input bit transitions from 0 to 1.

This implementation ensures that the output `pedge` is correctly updated one clock cycle after the 0 to 1 transition occurs on the input `in`.'}
