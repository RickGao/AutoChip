The original module specification had a few issues:

1. The `pedge` output should be a registered output, so we've added the `reg` keyword to it.
2. The logic to detect the 0 to 1 transition was missing. We've added the logic `in & ~in_prev` to detect when the current input `in` is 1 and the previous input `in_prev` was 0.
3. We've added a register `in_prev` to store the previous input value and used it in the logic to detect the transition.

The completed module correctly implements the positive edge detection on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output one cycle after the transition occurs.'}
