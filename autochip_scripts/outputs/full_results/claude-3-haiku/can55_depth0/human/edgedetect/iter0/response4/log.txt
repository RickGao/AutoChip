The provided Verilog module correctly implements the positive edge detection logic as per the given specification. The key points are:

1. The `in_d1` register is used to store the previous input value for each bit in the 8-bit vector.
2. In the `always` block, the current input value (`in`) is stored in `in_d1` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `pedge` output is calculated by performing a bitwise AND between the current input value (`in`) and the negation of the previous input value (`~in_d1`). This detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit and sets the corresponding bit in `pedge`.

The module is complete and should work as expected.'}
