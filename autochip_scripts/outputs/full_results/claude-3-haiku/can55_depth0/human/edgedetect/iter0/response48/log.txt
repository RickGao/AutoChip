The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `in_prev` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` input signal.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`), the following operations are performed:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev`.
   - The `pedge` output is calculated as the bitwise AND of the current `in` value and the negated previous `in_prev` value (`in & ~in_prev`). This detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector.

The module should compile and function as expected, providing the desired positive edge detection behavior.'}
