The corrected module does the following:

1. Introduces a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block, it first updates the `in_prev` register with the current value of `in`.
3. Then, it calculates the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the current value of `in` and the negation of the previous value `in_prev`. This will set the output bit `pedge` high only when the corresponding bit in `in` transitions from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector `in`.'}
