The provided Verilog module correctly implements the specified functionality. The key points are:

1. The `prev_in` register is used to store the previous value of the input signal `in`.
2. On each positive edge of the clock, the current input value is stored in `prev_in`.
3. The output `pedge` is assigned the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the negation of the previous input `~prev_in`. This effectively sets the output bit high only if the corresponding input bit has changed from 0 to 1 between the current and previous clock cycles.

This ensures that the output `pedge` will be set to 1 for the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs on any bit of the input `in`.'}
