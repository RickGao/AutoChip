The corrected Verilog module performs the following functionality:

1. It declares an 8-bit register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, it performs the following:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to the `in_prev` register.
   - Calculates the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the current value of `in` and the bitwise negation of the previous value `in_prev`. This ensures that the output `pedge` is set to 1 only for the bits that have transitioned from 0 to 1.

This module correctly implements the positive edge detection for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`.'}
