This Verilog module implements the desired functionality of detecting a positive edge (0 to 1 transition) on each bit of an 8-bit vector. Here's how it works:

1. The module has an 8-bit input `in`, an 8-bit output `pedge`, and a clock input `clk`.
2. It declares a `in_prev` register to store the previous value of `in`.
3. In the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock, the module does the following:
   - Stores the current value of `in` into `in_prev`.
   - Computes the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the current `in` value and the negated previous `in_prev` value, and assigns the result to `pedge`.

This way, the `pedge` output will be set to 1 for the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs on any bit of the `in` vector.'}
