The provided Verilog module specification is correct and the completed module is provided above. The key steps are:

1. Store the previous input value in the `prev_in` register.
2. At each positive edge of the clock, update the `prev_in` register with the current input value `in`.
3. Calculate the positive edge detection output `pedge` by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current input `in` and the negation of the previous input `~prev_in`. This will set the output bit high only if the corresponding input bit changed from 0 to 1.'}
