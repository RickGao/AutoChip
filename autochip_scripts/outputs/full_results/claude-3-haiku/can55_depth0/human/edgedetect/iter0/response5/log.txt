The provided Verilog code is correct and should work as expected. The module takes an 8-bit input signal `in` and a clock input `clk`, and generates an 8-bit output `pedge` which is set to 1 for the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition is detected on the corresponding bit of the input signal.

The key elements are:

1. The `in_d1` register stores the previous value of the input signal `in`.
2. In the always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, the current input `in` is stored in `in_d1`.
3. The output `pedge` is then calculated as the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the inverted previous input `~in_d1`. This detects the 0 to 1 transition, and the output is set for the next cycle.

This implementation ensures that the output `pedge` is correctly generated for each bit of the 8-bit input signal.'}
