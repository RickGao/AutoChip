The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous state of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev`, effectively storing the previous state.
   - Computes the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` and the negated previous `in_prev`. This results in a `1` for each bit where the input changed from `0` to `1`, and `0` otherwise.
   - Assigns the positive edge detection result to the output `pedge`.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge of each bit in the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding output bit the cycle after the transition occurs.'}
