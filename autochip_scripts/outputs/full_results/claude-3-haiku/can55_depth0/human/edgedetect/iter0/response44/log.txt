The provided Verilog code correctly implements the specified functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_prev` register stores the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, the following happens:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev`.
   - The `pedge` output is assigned the bitwise AND of the current `in` and the negated previous `in_prev`. This effectively sets the output bit only when the corresponding input bit changes from 0 to 1 (a positive edge).

This implementation ensures that the `pedge` output correctly detects the 0 to 1 transitions for each bit of the 8-bit input vector.'}
