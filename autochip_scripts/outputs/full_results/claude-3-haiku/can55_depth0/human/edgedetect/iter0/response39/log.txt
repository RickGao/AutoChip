The corrected module performs the following:

1. It declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous input value.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, it first updates the `in_prev` register with the current input value (`in`).
3. It then performs a bitwise AND operation between the current input value (`in`) and the negated previous input value (`~in_prev`). This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit and sets the corresponding output bit (`pedge`) high.

This implementation correctly detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding output bit in the cycle after the transition occurs.'}
