The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. It declares a `reg` variable `in_prev` to store the previous value of the `in` signal.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   - It updates the `in_prev` register with the current value of `in`.
   - It calculates the `pedge` output by performing a bitwise AND between the current `in` value and the inverse of the previous `in_prev` value. This effectively detects the 0-to-1 transition on each bit of the input vector.

This logic correctly implements the specified behavior of detecting the 0-to-1 transition on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and setting the corresponding output bit one cycle after the transition occurs.'}
