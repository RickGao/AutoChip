This Verilog module implements the circuit as described. The key components are:

1. A D flip-flop (`out`) that is positive edge triggered by the `clk` input. The D input of the flip-flop is connected to the output of a two-input XOR gate, which takes `in` and the current output `out` as inputs.
2. The XOR gate is implemented using the Verilog `^` operator, with the XOR expression assigned to the `d` variable, which is then connected to the D input of the flip-flop.
3. The positive edge triggered D flip-flop is implemented using the `always_ff` construct, which updates the `out` output on the positive edge of the `clk` input.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the specified circuit.'}
