The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given circuit specification. It consists of the following components:

1. An XOR gate that takes `in` and the output `out` as inputs and generates the `xor_out` signal.
2. A positive-edge triggered D flip-flop that takes the `xor_out` signal as its input and assigns it to the output `out` on each clock edge.

The module has no reset input, as specified in the problem statement.'}
