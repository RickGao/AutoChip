This Verilog module implements the requested circuit. It consists of a two-input XOR gate that takes `in` and the output `out` of the D flip-flop, and a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop that holds the output of the XOR gate.

The `always_ff` block is a Verilog construct that describes the behavior of the D flip-flop. On the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, the output `out` is updated with the value of the XOR gate output `xor_out`.'}
