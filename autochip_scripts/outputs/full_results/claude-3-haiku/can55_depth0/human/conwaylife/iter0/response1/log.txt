{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state.

The provided Verilog code implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module takes in a clock signal, a load signal, and an initial state of the game (256-bit data input), and updates the game state on each clock cycle according to the rules of the Game of Life.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `next_state` register that holds the next state of the game after applying the rules to the current state.
2. The nested loops that iterate over each cell in the grid and calculate the number of neighbors for the current cell.
3. The conditional logic that updates the next state of each cell based on the number of neighbors, following the rules of the Game of Life.
4. The update of the `q` register, which stores the current state of the game, based on the `load` signal and the `next_state`.

The module should correctly implement the Game of Life on the 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
