{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

The provided Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and an initial state `data`, and updates the current state `q` at each clock cycle according to the rules of the Game of Life.

The main logic is implemented in the always block that computes the next state of the game. For each cell, the number of alive neighbors is calculated, taking into account the toroidal wrapping of the grid. The next state of the cell is then determined based on the Game of Life rules.

The updated state is then stored in the `q` register at the next clock cycle, unless the `load` signal is active, in which case the initial state `data` is loaded into `q`.'}
