{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

The Verilog module provided implements the Game of Life simulation on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The main features of the module are:

1. The `next_state` register is used to compute the next state of the grid based on the current state `q`.
2. The `always @(*)` block computes the number of neighbors for each cell and applies the game rules to determine the next state.
3. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the grid state `q` either by loading the initial state from `data` when `load` is high, or by updating to the next state computed in the combinational logic.
4. The `q` output is the current state of the 16x16 grid, updated every clock cycle.
5. The module handles the toroidal boundary conditions by using the modulo operator `%` to wrap around the grid edges.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the Game of Life simulation as specified.'}
