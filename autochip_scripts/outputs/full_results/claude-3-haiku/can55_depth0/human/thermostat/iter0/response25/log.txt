Implement a circuit that will turn on and off the heater, air conditioning, and blower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the heater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air conditioner.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The module correctly implements the desired functionality for the heating/cooling thermostat based on the given requirements.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0).
2. In heating mode, the heater is turned on when `too_cold` is high, and the fan is turned on only when the heater is on.
3. In cooling mode, the air conditioner is turned on when `too_hot` is high, and the fan is turned on only when the air conditioner is on.
4. Regardless of the mode, the fan is turned on if `fan_on` is high, even if the heater and air conditioner are off.
5. The outputs `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan` are assigned using `always @(*)` block, which ensures that the outputs are updated as soon as any of the inputs change.

This Verilog module should compile and function correctly based on the provided specification.'}
