{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want to create a timer with one input that:\n\n// (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input until it resumes searching after everything else is done.\n\n// The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. \n\n// When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).\n\n// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous. \n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput wire clk,\n\tinput wire reset,\n\tinput wire data,\n    output wire [3:0] count,\n    output reg counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input wire ack );"}

This Verilog module implements the timer functionality as described in the problem statement. The module has the following main components:

1. `state` register to keep track of the current state of the state machine.
2. `shift_reg` to capture the input data pattern and the delay value.
3. `delay` register to store the delay value.
4. `counter` to count the number of clock cycles for the delay.
5. `counting` and `done` output signals to indicate the timer's state.

The state machine transitions through the following states:
- `IDLE`: Continuously shifts in the input data and checks for the start pattern (1101).
- `DETECT_PATTERN`: Captures the next 4 bits after the start pattern to determine the delay value.
- `CAPTURE_DELAY`: Stores the delay value and starts the countdown.
- `COUNT_DOWN`: Decrements the counter and updates the `count` output.
- `NOTIFY`: Asserts the `done` signal to notify the user that the timer has timed out.
- `WAIT_ACK`: Waits for the user to acknowledge the timer by asserting the `ack` input.

The module resets to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` signal is asserted.'}
