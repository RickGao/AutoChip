{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput reg [1:0] pos\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module for a 4-bit priority encoder is provided above. The key changes are:

1. The `casez` statement is used to handle the priority encoding. The `casez` statement allows for don't care conditions using the `?` symbol.
2. The cases are checked in descending order of priority, starting from the most significant bit.
3. If none of the input bits are high, the default case sets the `pos` output to 2'b00.

This implementation ensures that the correct position of the first high bit is output, and the default case handles the scenario where all input bits are low.'}
