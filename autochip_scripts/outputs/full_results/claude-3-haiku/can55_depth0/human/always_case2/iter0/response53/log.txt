{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput reg [1:0] pos\n);"}
{'assistant': 'Here is the completed Verilog module for a 4-bit priority encoder:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [3:0] in,
    output reg [1:0] pos
);

always @(*) begin
    casez (in)
        4'b1??? : pos = 2'd3;
        4'b01?? : pos = 2'd2;
        4'b001? : pos = 2'd1;
        4'b0001 : pos = 2'd0;
        default : pos = 2'd0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

The priority encoder works as follows:

1. The `always @(*)` block is a combinational logic block that gets triggered whenever the input `in` changes.
2. Inside the `case` statement, we check the input `in` bit-by-bit, starting from the most significant bit.
3. The `casez` construct allows us to use wildcards (`?`) to match multiple input combinations at once.
4. If the most significant bit is 1, we set the output `pos` to 3.
5. If the second most significant bit is 1, we set the output `pos` to 2.
6. If the third most significant bit is 1, we set the output `pos` to 1.
7. If the least significant bit is 1, we set the output `pos` to 0.
8. If none of the input bits are high (i.e., the input is 0), we set the output `pos` to 0.

This covers all 16 possible input combinations for a 4-bit priority encoder.'}
