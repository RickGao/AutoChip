{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput reg [1:0] pos\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a 4-bit priority encoder as per the given specifications. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module is named `top_module` and has one 4-bit input `in` and one 2-bit output `pos`.
2. The `always @(*)` block implements the combinational logic of the priority encoder.
3. Inside the `case` statement, the input `in` is checked for each possible combination of the 4 bits. The corresponding 2-bit output `pos` is assigned based on the position of the first '1' bit in the input.
4. If none of the input bits are high (i.e., the input is 0), the output `pos` is set to 2'b00.

This code correctly implements the 4-bit priority encoder as per the given problem statement.'}
