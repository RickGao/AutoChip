The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. In the `always` block, the `case` statement correctly assigns the output `out` based on the `do_sub` input.
2. The condition for setting `result_is_zero` has been corrected to directly compare the output `out` with 0, instead of using the `~` operator, which would only work if the output is exactly 0.

This corrected module should now work as expected, setting the `result_is_zero` output correctly based on the result of the addition or subtraction operation.'}
