This Verilog module implements the timer functionality as per the given specification. Here's how it works:

1. The module has four ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input
   - `load`: The load signal that determines whether to load the `data` value into the counter or decrement the counter
   - `data`: The 10-bit data value to be loaded into the counter
   - `tc`: The output signal that indicates when the counter has reached 0 (terminal count)

2. The module uses a 10-bit register `counter` to store the current count value.

3. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock:
   - If `load` is 1, the `counter` is loaded with the `data` value.
   - If `load` is 0 and the `counter` is not 0, the `counter` is decremented by 1.
   - The `tc` output is set to 1 when the `counter` reaches 0, and remains 1 until the counter is loaded again.

This implementation ensures that the timer counts down correctly, loads the new value when `load` is 1, and asserts the `tc` signal when the counter reaches 0.'}
