{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed. A good way to implement this is with a down-counter that asserts an output signal when the count becomes 0.

The counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. \n// (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk, \n\tinput load, \n\tinput [9:0] data, \n\toutput tc\n);'}

The module above implements the desired timer functionality. Here's how it works:

1. On a positive clock edge, the module checks the value of the `load` input:
   - If `load` is high, the module loads the 10-bit `data` input into the `counter` register and sets the `tc` output to 0.
   - If `load` is low, the module checks the value of the `counter` register:
     - If `counter` is not 0, the module decrements the `counter` register by 1 and sets the `tc` output to 0.
     - If `counter` is 0, the module sets the `tc` output to 1 to indicate that the timer has reached the end of its count.

The module uses a single register, `counter`, to keep track of the remaining count. The `tc` output is driven based on the value of the `counter` register, asserting when the counter reaches 0.'}
