{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed.

Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk, \n\tinput load, \n\tinput [9:0] data, \n\toutput tc\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a timer module as per the given specification. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has four ports:
   - `clk`: The input clock signal.
   - `load`: The signal to load the timer with a new value.
   - `data`: The 10-bit value to load into the timer.
   - `tc`: The output signal that indicates when the timer has reached 0.

2. The module has a 10-bit register `counter` to store the current timer value.

3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
   - If `load` is high, the `counter` is loaded with the value from `data`, and the `tc` output is set to 0.
   - If `load` is low and the `counter` is not 0, the `counter` is decremented by 1, and the `tc` output is set to 1 when the `counter` reaches 1 (indicating the terminal count).
   - If the `counter` is 0, the `tc` output is set to 1.

This implementation ensures that the timer counts down the specified number of clock cycles and asserts the `tc` output signal when the countdown reaches 0. The timer can be reloaded with a new value at any time, including while it is still counting down.'}
