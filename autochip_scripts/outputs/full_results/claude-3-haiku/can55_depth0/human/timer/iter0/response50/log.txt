{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The internal counter is represented by the `count` register, which is a 10-bit wide register.
2. On each clock cycle, the module checks the `load` signal:
   - If `load` is 1, the `count` register is loaded with the `data` value, and the `tc` output is set to 0.
   - If `load` is 0, the module checks the value of `count`:
     - If `count` is not 0, it decrements the `count` register and sets the `tc` output to 1 when `count` reaches 1.
     - If `count` is 0, it keeps the `tc` output at 1.

This implementation ensures that the `tc` output is asserted when the internal counter reaches 0, and stays asserted until the counter is loaded with a new value.'}
