The provided Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The `reset` input is a synchronous active high reset that sets the counter `q` to 0.

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` input. Inside the block, the following logic is implemented:

1. If the `reset` input is high, the counter `q` is set to 0 (`4'b0000`).
2. If the `reset` input is low, the counter `q` is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 9 (`4'd9`), it is reset to 0 (`4'b0000`) to start the cycle again.

This implementation ensures the counter counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, and resets to 0 when the maximum value is reached.'}
