The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The counter `q` is declared as a 4-bit register, which can represent the values from 0 to 9 (inclusive).
2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. Within the `always` block, the counter is updated as follows:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 9 (binary value 1001), it is reset to 0 to start the next decade.

This implementation provides a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets the counter to 0 when the `reset` input is active high.'}
