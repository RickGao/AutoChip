The provided Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the active high synchronous reset signal).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 4-bit register that holds the current count value.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is set to 0 (`q <= 4'b0000`).
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 9 (4'b1001), it is reset to 0 (`q <= (q == 4'b1001) ? 4'b0000 : q + 1'b1`).

This implementation ensures that the decade counter correctly counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, and resets to 0 upon a high `reset` signal.'}
