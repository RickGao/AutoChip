The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be completed as shown above. The key aspects are:

1. The counter is a 4-bit register `q` to represent the values from 0 to 9.
2. The counter is incremented on every positive edge of the clock `clk`.
3. The counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
4. The counter increments from 0 to 9 and then rolls over to 0.

The completed module handles the reset condition and the counter increment/rollover logic correctly.'}
