This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high and synchronous, which resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block checks for the `reset` signal on the positive edge of `clk`. If `reset` is high, the counter `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 until it reaches 9, at which point it wraps around to 0.'}
