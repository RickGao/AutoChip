The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` takes two input signals: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the synchronous reset signal), and one output signal `q` (the 4-bit counter output).
2. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, the counter `q` is set to `4'b0000` (0).
3. If `reset` is low, the module checks if the current value of `q` is equal to `4'b1001` (9). If so, it sets `q` to `4'b0000` (0), effectively resetting the counter. Otherwise, it increments the counter by 1.
4. This behavior creates a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10.'}
