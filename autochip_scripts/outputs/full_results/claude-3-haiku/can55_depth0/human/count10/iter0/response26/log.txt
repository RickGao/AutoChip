This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key elements of the implementation are:

1. The `q` register is a 4-bit wide register to hold the counter value, which can range from 0 to 9.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the `if` statement checks if the `reset` input is high. If so, the counter is reset to 0.
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the counter is incremented by 1. The condition `(q == 4'd9)` checks if the current value of `q` is 9, in which case the counter is reset to 0.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 9 and then wraps around to 0, forming a decade counter with a period of 10.'}
