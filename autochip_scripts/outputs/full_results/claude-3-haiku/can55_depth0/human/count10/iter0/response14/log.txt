This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block checks for the reset signal. If reset is high, the counter is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 on each positive edge of the clock. When the counter reaches 9 (4'b1001), it is reset to 0 on the next clock cycle.'}
