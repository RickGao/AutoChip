The corrected Verilog module includes the following:

1. The module declaration with the appropriate input and output ports.
2. The `always` block that handles the counter logic:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented on each positive edge of the clock.
   - When the counter reaches 9, it is reset back to 0.

The module correctly implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 and resets to 0 on the next clock cycle after reaching 9. The synchronous reset is also implemented correctly.'}
