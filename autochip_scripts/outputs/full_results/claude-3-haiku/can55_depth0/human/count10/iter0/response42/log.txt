The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 4-bit width to represent the decade counter.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `reset` input is high, the counter `q` is set to 0 (`4'b0000`).
4. If the `reset` input is low, the counter `q` is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle, wrapping around from 9 (`4'b1001`) to 0 (`4'b0000`).

This implementation satisfies the given requirements for a decade counter with a synchronous reset.'}
