The completed Verilog module for the given specification is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` takes two inputs: `in` (a 1024-bit vector) and `sel` (an 8-bit selector) and produces a 4-bit output `out`.
2. The `assign` statement uses the Verilog slice syntax `in[4*sel +: 4]` to select the appropriate 4-bit slice from the 1024-bit `in` vector based on the `sel` input. The `4*sel` part of the expression calculates the starting bit position for the desired 4-bit slice, and the `+: 4` part selects the 4-bit slice starting from that position.
3. This effectively implements a 256-to-1 multiplexer, where the `sel` input selects which 4-bit slice of the 1024-bit `in` vector is routed to the 4-bit `out` output.'}
