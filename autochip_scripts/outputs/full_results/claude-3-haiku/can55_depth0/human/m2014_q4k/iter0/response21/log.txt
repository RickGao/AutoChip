The corrected Verilog module implements a 4-bit shift register with synchronous active-low reset. The `shift_reg` register is a 4-bit wide register that stores the shifted data. On each clock edge, the register is updated with the new input value being shifted into the least significant bit, and the previous values being shifted one position to the left. If the reset signal `resetn` is low, the register is cleared to all zeros. The output `out` is assigned the most significant bit of the `shift_reg` register.'}
