This Verilog code implements the given finite state machine circuit description. The key elements are:

1. Declare three D flip-flop output registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
2. Implement the XOR, AND, and OR gates using the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs/complements.
3. Implement the XNOR gate using the outputs of the XOR, AND, and OR gates.
4. Update the D flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` on the positive edge of the clock signal.

The circuit operates as follows:
- The input `x` is fed into the XOR, AND, and OR gates.
- The outputs of these gates are then fed into the corresponding D flip-flops.
- The outputs of the D flip-flops are then combined using an XNOR gate, whose output is `z`.'}
