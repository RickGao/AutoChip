The key aspects of this Verilog code are:

1. Instantiation of three D flip-flops to hold the current state of the finite state machine.
2. Wiring of the input `x` to the three different logic gates (XOR, AND, OR).
3. Connecting the outputs of the logic gates to the D inputs of the respective flip-flops.
4. Connecting the flip-flop outputs and their complements to the three-input XNOR gate to produce the output `z`.
5. Defining a separate `dff` module to implement the D flip-flop behavior.

The D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins, as specified in the problem statement.'}
