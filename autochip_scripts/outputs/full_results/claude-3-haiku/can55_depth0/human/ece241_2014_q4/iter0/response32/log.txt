The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It consists of a top-level module `top_module` that instantiates three D flip-flops and the necessary combinational logic.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The three D flip-flops are instantiated as `dff` modules, with their inputs and outputs connected to the appropriate signals.
2. The combinational logic is implemented using Verilog assignments:
   - `d1` is the XOR of the input `x` and the output of the first flip-flop `q1`.
   - `d2` is the AND of the input `x` and the complemented output of the second flip-flop `q2_n`.
   - `d3` is the OR of the input `x` and the complemented output of the third flip-flop `q3_n`.
3. The output `z` is the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
4. The `dff` module is a separate module that implements the D flip-flop behavior, updating the `q` and `q_n` (complemented) outputs on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
