The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the given specification. The key steps are:

1. Declare three D flip-flops `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the outputs of the corresponding logic gates.
2. Create the combinational logic for the XOR, AND, and OR gates, using the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs.
3. Implement the XNOR gate using the outputs of the three combinational logic gates.
4. Update the D flip-flops on the positive edge of the clock signal with the corresponding combinational logic outputs.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the specification.'}
