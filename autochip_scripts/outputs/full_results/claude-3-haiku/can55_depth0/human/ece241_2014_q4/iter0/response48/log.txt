The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It consists of the following components:

1. `top_module`: This is the main module that defines the circuit. It has two inputs (`clk` and `x`) and one output (`z`).

2. XOR, AND, and OR gates: These are implemented using assign statements, where the inputs to the gates are the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs (`q1`, `q2`, and `q3`).

3. D Flip-Flops: The `dff_reset` module is used to implement the D flip-flops. Each flip-flop has a clock input (`clk`), a data input (`d`), and two outputs (`q` and `nq`). The flip-flops are initialized to 0 in the `initial` block.

4. XNOR gate: The XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs (`q1`, `q2`, and `q3`) is implemented to produce the final output `z`.

The `dff_reset` module is a custom module that implements a D flip-flop with a reset functionality. It initializes the `q` and `nq` outputs to 0 and 1, respectively, and then updates the outputs on the positive edge of the clock signal.'}
