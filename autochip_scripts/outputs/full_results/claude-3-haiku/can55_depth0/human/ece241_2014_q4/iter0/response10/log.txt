The Verilog code above implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` has two inputs (`clk` and `x`) and one output (`z`).
2. The module declares three internal registers (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`) to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). Inside the block, the values of the D flip-flop outputs are updated based on the input `x` and the previous values of the flip-flop outputs.
   - `q1 <= (x ^ q1)`: The first D flip-flop is updated using the XOR of the input `x` and the previous value of `q1`.
   - `q2 <= (x & ~q2)`: The second D flip-flop is updated using the AND of the input `x` and the complement of the previous value of `q2`.
   - `q3 <= (x | ~q3)`: The third D flip-flop is updated using the OR of the input `x` and the complement of the previous value of `q3`.
4. The output `z` is assigned the value of the XNOR of the three D flip-flop outputs (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`).

This Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
