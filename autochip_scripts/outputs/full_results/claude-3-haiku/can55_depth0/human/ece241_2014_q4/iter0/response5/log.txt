This Verilog module implements the described finite state machine circuit. The key aspects are:

1. The module has three D flip-flops to store the current state, which is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal.
2. The three gates (XOR, AND, OR) are implemented using Verilog expressions and their outputs are connected to the corresponding D flip-flop inputs.
3. The final output `z` is the XNOR of the three gate outputs, which is assigned using the `assign` statement.

The initial reset state of the D flip-flops is not explicitly set, as the problem statement assumes they are initially reset to 0 before the machine begins operation.'}
