The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `top_module` defines the main module with the given inputs and output.
2. Inside the `top_module`, three D flip-flops are instantiated using the `dff` module. The inputs to the D flip-flops are computed based on the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs.
3. The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop implementation, where the output `q` is assigned the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock, and the complementary output `q_bar` is assigned the negation of `d`.
4. Finally, the output `z` is computed as the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs.

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
