The Verilog code provided implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` takes two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `x` (the input signal), and produces one output `z`.

2. Three D flip-flops (`q1`, `q2`, and `q3`) are declared to store the state of the circuit.

3. The combinational logic is implemented using three intermediate wires: `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out`. These wires are connected to the corresponding gates as described in the problem statement.

4. The XNOR output `z` is assigned as the negation of the XOR of `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out`.

5. In the always block, the D flip-flops are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal with the corresponding combinational logic outputs.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops to zero is assumed to be handled externally, as the problem statement does not specify any reset logic.'}
