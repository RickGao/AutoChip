The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It consists of the following components:

1. The `top_module` which takes `clk` and `x` as inputs and produces `z` as the output.
2. Within the `top_module`, three D flip-flops (`ff1`, `ff2`, and `ff3`) are used to store the state of the machine.
3. The input `x` is connected to three different gates: an XOR gate, an AND gate, and an OR gate. The outputs of these gates are used as the inputs to the D flip-flops.
4. The outputs of the D flip-flops and their complements are used as the second inputs to the XOR, AND, and OR gates, respectively.
5. The outputs of the three D flip-flops are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is `z`.
6. The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop implementation that updates the `q` and `q_bar` outputs on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the given finite state machine circuit.'}
