This Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` takes two inputs: `clk` and `x`, and has one output `z`.
2. It declares three internal registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
3. It creates three intermediate wires `xor_gate`, `and_gate`, and `or_gate` to represent the outputs of the XOR, AND, and OR gates, respectively.
4. The XOR gate is implemented using the `^` operator, the AND gate is implemented using the `&` and `~` operators, and the OR gate is implemented using the `|` and `~` operators.
5. The `always` block updates the D flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
6. The final output `z` is the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs, implemented using the `^` and `~` operators.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
