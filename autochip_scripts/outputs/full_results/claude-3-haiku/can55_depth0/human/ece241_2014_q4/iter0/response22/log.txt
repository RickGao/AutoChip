The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It consists of the following components:

1. **top_module**: The top-level module that instantiates the D flip-flops and computes the XNOR of their outputs to produce the `z` output.
2. **dff**: A module that implements a D flip-flop with both `q` and `q_bar` outputs.

The key steps are:
- Declare the flip-flop output signals `q1`, `q2`, `q3` and their complementary outputs `q1_bar`, `q2_bar`, `q3_bar`.
- Instantiate the three D flip-flops with the appropriate logic connections based on the problem statement.
- Compute the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs to produce the `z` output.
- Implement the `dff` module to handle the D flip-flop behavior.

The provided code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
