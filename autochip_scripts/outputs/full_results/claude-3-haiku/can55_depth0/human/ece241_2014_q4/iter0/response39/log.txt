The Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit as described. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has three D flip-flop registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the state of the circuit.
2. The D inputs for the flip-flops are calculated using the given logic gates:
   - `d1 = x ^ q1` (XOR gate)
   - `d2 = x & ~q2` (AND gate with complemented feedback)
   - `d3 = x | ~q3` (OR gate with complemented feedback)
3. The D flip-flops are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal using the `always` block.
4. The final XNOR output `z` is calculated as `~(q1 ^ q2 ^ q3)`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
