This Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. The key steps are:

1. Declare the D flip-flop registers `d1`, `d2`, `d3`, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
2. Implement the combinational logic for the XOR, AND, and OR gates using continuous assignment statements.
3. Update the flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` on the positive edge of the clock using a always block.
4. Assign the next state values `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` in a separate always block.
5. Implement the final XNOR logic to generate the output `z` using a continuous assignment statement.

The initial reset condition for the D flip-flops is not explicitly specified, but the problem statement indicates that the flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins operation.'}
