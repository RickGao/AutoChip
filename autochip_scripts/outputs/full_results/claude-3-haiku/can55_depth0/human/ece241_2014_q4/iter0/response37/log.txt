```verilog
module top_module (

    wire q1, q2, q3;
    wire q1_bar, q2_bar, q3_bar;

);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
        q_bar <= ~d;
    end

endmodule
```

The key elements of the Verilog code are:

1. Instantiation of three D flip-flops (`dff`) with the appropriate connections to the input `x` and the complemented outputs.
2. The combinational logic for the three-input XNOR gate that computes the output `z`.
3. The `dff` module that implements the D flip-flop with both the normal and complemented outputs.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops to zero is handled by the default reset state of the D flip-flops, as they are initialized to zero when the circuit is powered on.'}
