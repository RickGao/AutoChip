The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It includes the following components:

1. `top_module`: This is the top-level module that instantiates the D flip-flops and the necessary gates.
2. `dff`: This is a module that defines a D flip-flop with a clock input, a data input (d), and outputs for the Q and Q_bar signals.

In the `top_module`, the D flip-flops are instantiated and connected to the inputs and outputs as described in the problem statement. The gates (XOR, AND, and OR) are implemented using Verilog assignment statements, and the final XNOR gate is also implemented using a Verilog assignment statement.

The `dff` module is a separate module that encapsulates the logic for a D flip-flop, with the Q and Q_bar outputs updated on the positive edge of the clock signal.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
