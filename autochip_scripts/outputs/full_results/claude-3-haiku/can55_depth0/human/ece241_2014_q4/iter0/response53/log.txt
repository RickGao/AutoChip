The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It consists of the following main components:

1. `top_module`: This is the top-level module that takes in the clock signal `clk` and the input `x`, and produces the output `z`.

2. `dff`: This is a D flip-flop module that takes in the clock signal `clk` and the input `d`, and produces the output `q` and its complement `q_bar`.

3. The `top_module` instantiates three `dff` modules to store the state of the circuit. The inputs to the D flip-flops are generated using XOR, AND, and OR gates, as described in the problem statement.

4. The output `z` is generated using a three-input XNOR gate on the outputs of the three D flip-flops.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops to zero is not explicitly shown in the code, as it is assumed to be handled by the system or the testbench.'}
