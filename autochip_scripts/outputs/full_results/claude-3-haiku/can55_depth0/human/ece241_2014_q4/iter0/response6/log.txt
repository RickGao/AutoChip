The Verilog code above implements the given finite state machine circuit. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three D flip-flops (`d1`, `d2`, and `d3`) to store the intermediate states.
2. The module implements the three logic gates (XOR, AND, and OR) as described in the problem statement.
3. The outputs of the logic gates are connected to the D inputs of the corresponding D flip-flops, which are updated on the positive edge of the clock.
4. The outputs of the D flip-flops are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is the final output `z`.

The D flip-flops are initially reset to zero, as specified in the problem statement.'}
