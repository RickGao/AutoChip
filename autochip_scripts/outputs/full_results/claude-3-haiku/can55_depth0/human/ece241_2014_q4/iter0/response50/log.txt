The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. Let's go through the details:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` and `x`, and one output: `z`.
2. Three D flip-flops are declared as `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
3. The combinational logic for the three gates (XOR, AND, and OR) is implemented using Verilog expressions.
4. The D inputs of the flip-flops are assigned with the corresponding gate outputs in an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock.
5. The combinational logic for the XNOR gate is implemented using the Verilog `^` operator, and the result is negated to produce the final output `z`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the specified finite state machine circuit.'}
