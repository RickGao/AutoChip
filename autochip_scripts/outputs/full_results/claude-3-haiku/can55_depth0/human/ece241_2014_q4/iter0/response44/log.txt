The Verilog code above implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` has two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `x` (the input signal), and one output `z`.
2. Three registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are declared to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
3. In the `always` block, the D flip-flops are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal:
   - `q1` is updated to the XOR of `x` and the previous value of `q1`.
   - `q2` is updated to the AND of `x` and the complement of the previous value of `q2`.
   - `q3` is updated to the OR of `x` and the previous value of `q3`.
4. The output `z` is assigned the negated XNOR of `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`, which implements the desired three-input XNOR gate.

This Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
