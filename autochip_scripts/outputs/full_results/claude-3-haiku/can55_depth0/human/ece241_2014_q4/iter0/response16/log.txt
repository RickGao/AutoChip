The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the following key components:

1. Three D flip-flops (`dff1`, `dff2`, and `dff3`) to store the state of the circuit.
2. Three gate logic circuits (`n1`, `n2`, and `n3`) that take the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs to generate the next state inputs for the flip-flops.
3. A three-input XNOR gate that combines the outputs of the three flip-flops to generate the final output `z`.
4. A separate `dff` module that implements the D flip-flop logic.

The D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the circuit begins operation, as specified in the problem statement.'}
