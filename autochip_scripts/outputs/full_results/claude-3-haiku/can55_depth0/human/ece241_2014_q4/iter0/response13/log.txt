The key aspects of the Verilog code are:

1. Declared three D flip-flop registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the state.
2. In the always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, updated the D flip-flop values based on the input `x` and the current state.
   - `q1 <= q1 ^ x;` implements the XOR gate
   - `q2 <= q2 & ~x;` implements the AND gate with the complemented input
   - `q3 <= q3 | ~x;` implements the OR gate with the complemented input
3. Assigned the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs to the output `z`.

The Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
