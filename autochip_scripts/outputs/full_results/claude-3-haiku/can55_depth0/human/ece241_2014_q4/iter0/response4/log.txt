The provided Verilog code implements the given finite state machine circuit. It includes the following components:

1. `top_module`: This is the main module that instantiates the D flip-flops and the logic gates.
2. `dff`: This is a module that implements a D flip-flop with both the output `q` and its complement `q_bar`.
3. The `xor`, `and`, and `or` gates are used to implement the logic operations based on the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs.
4. The `xnor` gate is used to combine the outputs of the three D flip-flops to produce the final output `z`.

The D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins, as specified in the problem statement.'}
