The Verilog module provided follows the circuit description accurately. It includes the D flip-flops, the complemented outputs, the three logic gates (XOR, AND, OR), and the final 3-input XNOR gate that produces the output `z`. The flip-flops are initialized to 0 as per the initial condition mentioned in the problem statement.'}
