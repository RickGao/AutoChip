The Verilog code above implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. The top-level module `top_module` instantiates three D flip-flops and the necessary combinational logic to implement the desired behavior.

The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop with a synchronous reset. It takes in a clock signal `clk`, a data input `d`, and produces the output `q` and its complement `q_bar`.

In the `top_module`, the three D flip-flops are instantiated and connected to the appropriate combinational logic. The inputs to the D flip-flops (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`) are calculated based on the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`). The final output `z` is the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit as described.'}
