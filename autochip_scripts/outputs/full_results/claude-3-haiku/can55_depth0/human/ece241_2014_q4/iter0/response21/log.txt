This Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The module has three internal registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
2. The `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out` signals are assigned the results of the XOR, AND, and OR gates, respectively, based on the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs.
3. The `always` block updates the flip-flop outputs on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The flip-flops are assigned the values of `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out` respectively.
4. The `z` output is assigned the negated XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs, as specified in the problem statement.

The module assumes that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins, as mentioned in the problem statement.'}
