The Verilog module provided here implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four states: `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, and `S3`.
2. The state transition logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `data`.
3. The output logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which sets the `start_shifting` output to `1` when the state is `S3`, indicating that the sequence "1101" has been found.
4. The state register is updated on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, and is reset to `S0` when the `reset` signal is high.

This module should correctly implement the specified functionality and handle the given requirements.'}
