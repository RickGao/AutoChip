The provided Verilog module is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and holds it there until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the first '1' in the sequence.
2. `DETECT_1`: Waits for the second '1' in the sequence.
3. `DETECT_10`: Waits for the '0' in the sequence.
4. `DETECT_101`: Detects the complete 1101 sequence and sets `start_shifting` to 1.

The module uses a case statement to transition between the states based on the current state and the input `data`. When the 1101 sequence is detected, the module sets `start_shifting` to 1 and holds it there until the `reset` input is asserted.'}
