The provided Verilog module is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, which remains high until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module has two states:
1. `SEARCH`: In this state, the module monitors the input `data` and transitions to the `FOUND` state when the sequence 1101 is detected.
2. `FOUND`: In this state, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high until the `reset` input is asserted, which causes the module to transition back to the `SEARCH` state.

The module uses a combinational logic block to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `data`. The current state is updated on the positive edge of the `clk` input, and the `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the state to the `SEARCH` state.'}
