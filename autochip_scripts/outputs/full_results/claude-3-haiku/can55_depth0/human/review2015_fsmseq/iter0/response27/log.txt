The provided Verilog module is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in the input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, which remains set until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.
2. `FOUND_1`: Waiting for the next '0' in the sequence.
3. `FOUND_11`: Waiting for the final '1' in the sequence.
4. `FOUND_101`: The sequence 1101 has been found, setting the `start_shifting` output to 1.

The state transitions are handled in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `data`. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the current state and sets the `start_shifting` output accordingly.'}
