The provided Verilog module is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` signal to 1, which remains high until the `reset` signal is asserted.

The module has five states:
- `S0`: Waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.
- `S1`: Waiting for the second '1' in the sequence.
- `S2`: Waiting for the '0' in the sequence.
- `S3`: Waiting for the final '1' in the sequence.
- `S4`: The sequence has been found, set `start_shifting` to 1.

The module transitions between these states based on the input `data` signal and the `reset` signal. When `reset` is high, the module resets to the initial state `S0` and sets `start_shifting` to 0.'}
