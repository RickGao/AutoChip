The corrected module uses a binary tree structure to efficiently count the number of '1's in the 255-bit input vector. The design consists of the following steps:

1. **Level 1**: Count the number of '1's in each 32-bit segment of the input vector using the `$countones()` system task.
2. **Level 2**: Sum the counts from Level 1 to get the total number of '1's in the 255-bit input vector, and assign the result to the `out` output.

This approach allows the population count to be calculated in a logarithmic time complexity, which is much more efficient than a naive linear search through all 255 bits.'}
