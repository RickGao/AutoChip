```

The key aspects of the solution are:

1. Divide the 255-bit input vector into 4 smaller 64-bit vectors.
2. Instantiate 4 instances of a 4-bit population count module to count the number of '1's in each 64-bit vector.
3. Sum the 4-bit population counts to get the final 8-bit output.

The `pop_count_4bit` module is a simple implementation that uses the `$countones` system function to count the number of '1's in the input vector.'}
