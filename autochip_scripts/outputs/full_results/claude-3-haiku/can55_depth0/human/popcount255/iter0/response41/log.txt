The key features of this solution are:

1. Divide the 255-bit input into 8 chunks of 32 bits each.
2. Use the `popcount_32` module to count the number of 1's in each 32-bit chunk.
3. Add the counts from the 32-bit chunks in two levels to get the final 8-bit output.
4. The `popcount_32` module uses the `$countones` system function to count the number of 1's in each 8-bit sub-chunk.

This solution scales well for larger input widths, as the hierarchical approach can be extended to handle larger inputs.'}
