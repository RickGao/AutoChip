The key steps in this implementation are:

1. Break down the 255-bit input vector into smaller 32-bit chunks and create a tree of population count modules to count the number of '1's in each chunk.
2. Combine the 32-bit population counts into 64-bit and 128-bit population counts using additional population count modules.
3. Finally, combine the 128-bit population count into a single 8-bit output.

The submodules `population_count_32`, `population_count_64`, and `population_count_128` use the Verilog `$countones()` function to count the number of '1's in the given input vector.'}
