The provided Verilog module implements the specified Moore state machine. The module has two states, `OFF` and `ON`, which are controlled by the input signals `j` and `k`. The asynchronous reset `areset` sets the state to `OFF` and the output `out` to 0.

In the `always` block, the state transition and output logic are defined. When the reset `areset` is high, the state is set to `OFF` and the output `out` is set to 0. Otherwise, the state transitions and output are updated based on the current state and input signals `j` and `k`.

When the state is `OFF`, if `j` is 1, the state transitions to `ON`. When the state is `ON`, if `k` is 1, the state transitions back to `OFF`. The output `out` is set to 0 in the `OFF` state and 1 in the `ON` state.'}
