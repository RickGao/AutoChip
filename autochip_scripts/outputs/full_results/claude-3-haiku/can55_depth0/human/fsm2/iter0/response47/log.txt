The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine with two states (OFF and ON), two inputs (j and k), and one output (out). The state machine behaves as follows:

1. If the system is in the OFF state (out = 0) and the input j is 0, the system remains in the OFF state (out = 0).
2. If the system is in the OFF state (out = 0) and the input j is 1, the system transitions to the ON state (out = 1).
3. If the system is in the ON state (out = 1) and the input k is 0, the system remains in the ON state (out = 1).
4. If the system is in the ON state (out = 1) and the input k is 1, the system transitions to the OFF state (out = 0).

The reset behavior is an active-high asynchronous reset to the OFF state (out = 0).'}
