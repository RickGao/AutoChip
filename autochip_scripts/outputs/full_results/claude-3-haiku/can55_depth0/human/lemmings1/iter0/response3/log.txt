{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has two states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming walking left or right, respectively. The module takes two input signals, `bump_left` and `bump_right`, which indicate when the Lemming has hit an obstacle on the left or right side, respectively. The module outputs two signals, `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which indicate the current direction of the Lemming.

The `always` block that updates the state and outputs is triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal or the asynchronous reset signal `areset`. If `areset` is high, the module resets the state to `LEFT` and sets `walk_left` to 1 and `walk_right` to 0, indicating that the Lemming is walking left.

The `always` block that computes the next state checks the current state and updates the next state based on the input signals. If the Lemming is in the `LEFT` state and `bump_right` is 1, the next state is set to `RIGHT`, indicating that the Lemming should start walking right. Similarly, if the Lemming is in the `RIGHT` state and `bump_left` is 1, the next state is set to `LEFT`, indicating that the Lemming should start walking left.

The module correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement.'}
