{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has two state parameters, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the two possible states the Lemming can be in: walking left or walking right.
2. The `state` register stores the current state of the Lemming.
3. The `always @(*)` block implements the next state logic. It evaluates the current state and the input signals (`bump_left` and `bump_right`) to determine the next state and the corresponding output signals (`walk_left` and `walk_right`).
4. The `always @(posedge clk, posedge areset)` block handles the synchronous reset. When the `areset` signal is high, the state is set to `LEFT`, resetting the Lemming to walk left.

This implementation ensures that the Lemming will switch directions when it is bumped on the left or right side, and the output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` will correctly reflect the Lemming's movement.'}
