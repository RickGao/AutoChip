{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

This Verilog module models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. It uses a Moore state machine with two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`. The module takes in the `clk`, `areset`, `bump_left`, and `bump_right` inputs, and produces the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs.

The module operates as follows:

1. When `areset` is high, the module resets to the `WALK_LEFT` state, sets `walk_left` to 1, and `walk_right` to 0.
2. On each positive edge of the `clk` signal, the module checks the current state and the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs to determine the next state and output values.
3. If the current state is `WALK_LEFT` and `bump_right` is 1, the module transitions to the `WALK_RIGHT` state, sets `walk_left` to 0, and `walk_right` to 1.
4. If the current state is `WALK_RIGHT` and `bump_left` is 1, the module transitions to the `WALK_LEFT` state, sets `walk_left` to 1, and `walk_right` to 0.
5. If the current state is not `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT`, the module resets to the `WALK_LEFT` state, sets `walk_left` to 1, and `walk_right` to 0.

The module should correctly model the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
