{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. The module has two states: `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming's direction of movement.

The `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs. If the Lemming is walking left and is bumped on the right, it will switch to walking right. Similarly, if the Lemming is walking right and is bumped on the left, it will switch to walking left.

The `output` logic sets the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs based on the current state. If the Lemming is in the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state, `walk_left` is set to 1 and `walk_right` is set to 0. If the Lemming is in the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state, `walk_left` is set to 0 and `walk_right` is set to 1.

The sequential logic includes an asynchronous reset (`areset`) that resets the state to `STATE_WALK_LEFT`.'}
