{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The above Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the Lemming walking left or right respectively.
2. The module uses two output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` to indicate the current direction of the Lemming.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.
4. When `areset` is high, the state is set to `LEFT` and `walk_left` is set to 1, while `walk_right` is set to 0.
5. In the `LEFT` state, if `bump_right` is high, the state transitions to `RIGHT`. In the `RIGHT` state, if `bump_left` is high, the state transitions to `LEFT`.
6. The output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` are updated based on the current state.

This module should correctly implement the desired Lemmings behavior as described in the problem statement.'}
