{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has two states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, which represent the walking direction of the Lemming. The module takes in four inputs: `clk`, `areset`, `bump_left`, and `bump_right`, and produces two outputs: `walk_left` and `walk_right`.

The module operates as follows:

1. On the positive edge of the `clk` signal, or when the `areset` signal is high, the module is reset to the `LEFT` state, and the `walk_left` output is set to 1, while the `walk_right` output is set to 0.
2. If the Lemming is in the `LEFT` state and the `bump_right` signal is high, the module transitions to the `RIGHT` state, and the outputs are updated accordingly.
3. If the Lemming is in the `RIGHT` state and the `bump_left` signal is high, the module transitions to the `LEFT` state, and the outputs are updated accordingly.

The module correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement.'}
