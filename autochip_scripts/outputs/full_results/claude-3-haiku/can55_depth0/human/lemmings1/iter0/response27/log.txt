{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings' behavior using a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and two outputs. The module operates as follows:

1. The initial state is `WALK_LEFT`, where the Lemming is walking left (`walk_left = 1'b1`, `walk_right = 1'b0`).
2. If the Lemming is bumped on the right (`bump_right = 1'b1`), it switches to the `WALK_RIGHT` state, where the Lemming is walking right (`walk_left = 1'b0`, `walk_right = 1'b1`).
3. If the Lemming is bumped on the left (`bump_left = 1'b1`), it switches back to the `WALK_LEFT` state.
4. The module also has an asynchronous reset (`areset`), which resets the state to `WALK_LEFT` and sets the outputs accordingly.

This implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem statement and should compile without any issues.'}
