{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system. The module has the following features:

1. It has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `load` to indicate when the system state should be loaded from `data[511:0]`, and an input `data[511:0]` to provide the initial state of the system.
2. It has an output `q[511:0]` that represents the current state of the 512-cell system.
3. The `always` block updates the state of the system on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` input is high, the current state is loaded from `data[511:0]`.
5. If the `load` input is low, the state of the system is updated according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton:
   - The first and last cells (q[0] and q[511]) are updated based on their immediate neighbors.
   - The remaining cells (q[1] to q[510]) are updated based on their left, center, and right neighbors according to the Rule 110 table.

The provided Verilog code should correctly implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system.'}
