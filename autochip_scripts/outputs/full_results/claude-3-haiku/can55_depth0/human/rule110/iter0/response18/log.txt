{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (a synchronous active-high input to load the initial state), and `data` (a 512-bit vector representing the initial state).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 512-bit vector representing the current state of the cellular automaton.
3. The `always` block is executed on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` input is high, the current state `q` is updated with the provided `data`.
5. If the `load` input is low, the next state of the cellular automaton is computed and stored in `q`:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is assigned the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - For the cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is computed based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors, according to the Rule 110 logic.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is assigned the value of the second-to-last cell `q[510]`.

This implementation ensures that the state of the cellular automaton is updated correctly at each clock cycle, with the boundary conditions (the leftmost and rightmost cells) being set to 0.'}
