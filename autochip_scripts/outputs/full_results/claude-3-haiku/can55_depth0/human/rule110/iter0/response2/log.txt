{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. The key features are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, `load` to indicate when the system state should be loaded from `data[511:0]`, and an output `q[511:0]` representing the current state of the cells.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated from the input `data`.
4. If `load` is low, the next state of each cell is computed based on the current state and the Rule 110 transition rules.
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are handled separately, as their neighbors beyond the 512-cell boundary are assumed to be 0.
   - The middle cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`) are updated based on the current cell and its two neighbors.
5. The updated state is assigned back to the output `q`.

This implementation should correctly simulate the Rule 110 cellular automaton with the given 512-cell system.'}
