{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The module takes the following inputs:
   - `clk`: Clock signal
   - `load`: Active-high load signal to load the initial state from `data`
   - `data`: 512-bit input data to load the initial state

2. The module has a single output:
   - `q`: 512-bit output representing the current state of the cellular automaton

3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the `data` input.
5. If the `load` signal is low, the module implements the Rule 110 logic to update the state of the cellular automaton:
   - The first and last cells (index 0 and 511) are updated based on the boundary condition (assuming both boundaries are 0).
   - The intermediate cells (index 1 to 510) are updated based on the Rule 110 logic, using the current state of the cell and its two neighbors.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell system advances by one time step each clock cycle, as per the Rule 110 cellular automaton.'}
