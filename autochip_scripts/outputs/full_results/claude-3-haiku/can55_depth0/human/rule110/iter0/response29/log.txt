{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as specified. The key aspects are:

1. The module has a 512-bit wide `q` register to store the state of the 512 cells.
2. On the positive edge of the `clk` signal, the module performs the following:
   - If `load` is high, the state is loaded from the `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the state is advanced by one time step according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton rules:
     - The leftmost cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
     - For each cell `q[i]` where `i` is from `1` to `510`, the next state is computed based on the Rule 110 logic: `(q[i-1] & q[i]) | (q[i] & q[i+1]) | (q[i-1] & q[i+1])`.
     - The rightmost cell `q[511]` is set to the value of the second-to-last cell `q[510]`.

This implementation ensures that the state of the 512-cell system is updated correctly according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton rules.'}
