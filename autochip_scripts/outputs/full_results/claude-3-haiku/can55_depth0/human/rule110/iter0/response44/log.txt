{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a 512-cell system that advances by one time step each clock cycle based on the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The module has the following features:

1. The `top_module` has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (an active-high signal that loads the initial state of the system), and `data` (a 512-bit input that holds the initial state of the system).
2. The `q` output is a 512-bit register that holds the current state of the system.
3. When `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the `data` input.
4. When `load` is low, the module advances the state of the system by one time step based on the Rule 110 cellular automaton:
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are handled separately, with the boundary conditions set to 0.
   - For the remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is calculated based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors, according to the Rule 110 transition rules.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton system as described in the problem statement.'}
