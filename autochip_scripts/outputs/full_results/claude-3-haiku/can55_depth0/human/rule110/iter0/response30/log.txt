{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (clock), `load` (active high load input), and `data` (511-bit input data).
2. The module has one output: `q` (511-bit output), which represents the state of the 512-cell system.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks if the `load` signal is high. If it is, the module loads the `data` input into the `q` output.
4. If the `load` signal is not high, the module updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are updated using the boundary conditions (both set to 0).
5. The rest of the cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`) are updated using the Rule 110 logic: `(q[i-1] & q[i]) | (q[i] & q[i+1]) | (q[i-1] & q[i+1])`.
6. This process is repeated on each clock cycle, advancing the state of the 512-cell system by one time step.'}
