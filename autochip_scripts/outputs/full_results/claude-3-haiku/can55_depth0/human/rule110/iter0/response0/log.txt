{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as per the given specification. The module has the following key features:

1. It has a 512-bit wide input `data` and output `q`, representing the state of the 512-cell system.
2. The `load` input determines whether the system state should be loaded with `data` or advanced by one time step.
3. The `always` block handles the state update logic:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the next state of each cell is computed based on the Rule 110 transition rules, as described in the problem statement.
   - The first and last cells (index 0 and 511) are handled separately to account for the boundary conditions.

This implementation should correctly simulate the Rule 110 cellular automaton as per the given specification.'}
