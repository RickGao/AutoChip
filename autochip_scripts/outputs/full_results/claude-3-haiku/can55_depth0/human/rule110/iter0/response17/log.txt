{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. The state of the system is stored in the `q` register, which is 512 bits wide to represent the 512 cells.
2. On the positive edge of the clock, if the `load` input is high, the `q` register is updated with the `data` input.
3. If the `load` input is not high, the next state of the system is computed by applying the Rule 110 logic to each cell.
4. The next state of each internal cell (`q[511:1]`) is computed using a combination of bitwise operations that implement the Rule 110 state transition logic.
5. The next state of the first cell (`q[0]`) is computed separately, since it depends on the boundary condition (the value of `q[511]`).

This implementation efficiently computes the next state of the 512-cell system in a single clock cycle, using only basic Verilog operators.'}
