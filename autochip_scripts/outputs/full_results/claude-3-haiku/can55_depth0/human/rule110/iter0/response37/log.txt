{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (a synchronous active-high load input), and `data` (a 512-bit input representing the initial state of the system).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 512-bit register that stores the current state of the cellular automaton.
3. On each positive edge of the clock, the module checks the `load` input:
   - If `load` is high, the module loads the `data` input into the `q` register.
   - If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton by applying the Rule 110 logic:
     - The first and last bits of `q` are set to the values of the second and second-to-last bits, respectively, to simulate the boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512] being both zero).
     - For each cell in the middle of the array (1 to 510), the next state is computed based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors, following the Rule 110 logic.
4. The updated state of the cellular automaton is stored in the `q` register and will be used in the next clock cycle.

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell cellular automaton according to the Rule 110 logic, and it allows the state to be loaded from the `data` input when the `load` input is high.'}
