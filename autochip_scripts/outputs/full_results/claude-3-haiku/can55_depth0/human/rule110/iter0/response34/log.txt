{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `load` to load the initial state, an input `data[511:0]` to provide the initial state, and an output `q[511:0]` to hold the current state of the cells.

2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is simply updated to the provided `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the state is updated according to the Rule 110 logic:
     - The cells are shifted one position to the right, with `q[511:1]` assigned from `q[510:0]`.
     - The new value of the leftmost cell `q[0]` is computed based on the rule, using the left neighbor `q[1]` and the current cell `q[0]`.

This implementation assumes the boundary conditions as specified, where the left and right boundary cells (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are both treated as 0 (off).'}
