{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The key aspects are:

1. The module has a 512-bit output `q` to represent the state of the 512-cell system.
2. The `always` block handles the behavior of the system:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the input `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the state is advanced by one time step according to the Rule 110 transition rules:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on `q[1]`.
     - For the internal cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is calculated based on the current cell and its two neighbors.
     - The last cell `q[511]` is updated based on `q[510]`.

This implementation correctly simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton and advances the state of the system by one time step on each clock cycle.'}
