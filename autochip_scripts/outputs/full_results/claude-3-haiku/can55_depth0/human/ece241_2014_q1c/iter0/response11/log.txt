The completed Verilog module for the given specification is as follows:

1. The module has four ports: `a` and `b` are the two 8-bit 2's complement input numbers, `s` is the 8-bit output sum, and `overflow` is the output signal indicating whether a signed overflow has occurred.
2. An internal 9-bit wire `sum` is used to store the result of the addition of `a` and `b`.
3. The addition of `a` and `b` is performed using the `+` operator, and the result is assigned to `sum`.
4. The lower 8 bits of `sum` are assigned to the output `s`.
5. The `overflow` output is assigned based on the condition that the two input numbers have the same sign (`a[7] == b[7]`) and the sign of the result (`sum[7]`) is different from the sign of the two input numbers.

This module correctly handles the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects the occurrence of a signed overflow.'}
