The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality. It takes two 8-bit 2's complement numbers `a` and `b` as inputs, computes the sum `s` by adding the two numbers, and also computes whether a signed overflow has occurred, which is stored in the `overflow` output.

The key steps are:

1. The 9-bit `sum` wire is used to hold the result of the addition, with the most significant bit being the sign bit.
2. The `s` output is assigned the lower 8 bits of the `sum` wire.
3. The `overflow` output is determined by checking if the sign bits of `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign bit of the sum `sum[7]` is different, indicating a signed overflow.

This module should compile and function correctly for the given specification.'}
