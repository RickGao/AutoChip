The Verilog module provided here correctly implements the given specification. Here's how it works:

1. The input signals `a` and `b` are 8-bit 2's complement numbers.
2. The `sum` signal is declared as a 9-bit wire to accommodate the potential overflow.
3. The `sum` signal is assigned the sum of `a` and `b` using the `+` operator.
4. The 8 least significant bits of `sum` are assigned to the output `s`.
5. The `overflow` output is assigned a value based on the following condition:
   - If the MSBs (sign bits) of `a` and `b` are the same, and the MSB of the sum `s` is different from the MSBs of `a` and `b`, then an overflow has occurred.

This module correctly handles 8-bit 2's complement addition and detects overflow cases.'}
