The corrected Verilog module performs the following steps:

1. Declares a 9-bit wire `sum` to hold the intermediate sum of the two 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`.
2. Assigns the sum of the zero-extended `a` and `b` to `sum` using the `+` operator.
3. Assigns the lower 8 bits of `sum` to the output `s`.
4. Assigns the overflow condition by checking if the most significant bit of `sum` (bit 8) is different from the sign bit of `sum` (bit 7). This indicates an overflow has occurred.

The key changes are:
- Using a 9-bit `sum` wire to accommodate the possible carry bit.
- Zero-extending `a` and `b` to 9 bits before addition to avoid sign extension issues.
- Checking the overflow condition by comparing the most significant bit with the sign bit of the sum.'}
