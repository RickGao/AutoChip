The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the above code implements the 4-bit shift register with the specified behavior.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has an asynchronous reset (`areset`) that sets the `q` register to zero.
2. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`) or the positive edge of the asynchronous reset (`areset`).
3. Inside the `always` block, the reset condition is checked first. If `areset` is high, `q` is set to 4'b0.
4. If `areset` is not high, the `load` and `ena` signals are checked:
   - If `load` is high, `q` is loaded with the `data` input.
   - If `load` is not high but `ena` is high, `q` is shifted right by one bit, effectively performing a right shift operation.

This implementation ensures that the 4-bit shift register behaves as specified, with the `load` input having higher priority over the `ena` input when both are asserted.'}
