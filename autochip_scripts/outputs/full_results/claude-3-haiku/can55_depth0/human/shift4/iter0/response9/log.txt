This Verilog module implements a 4-bit shift register with the following features:

1. Asynchronous positive edge triggered reset (areset): When `areset` is high, the shift register is reset to zero (`q <= 4'b0000`).

2. Synchronous active high load: When `load` is high, the shift register is loaded with the value of `data[3:0]` (`q <= data`).

3. Synchronous active high enable (ena): When `ena` is high, the shift register is shifted right by one bit (`q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]}`). The most significant bit (`q[3]`) becomes zero, and the least significant bit (`q[0]`) is shifted out and disappears.

4. The load operation has higher priority than the shift operation. If both `load` and `ena` are asserted, the load operation will be performed.

The module uses a single `always` block to handle the asynchronous reset, the synchronous load, and the synchronous shift operations. The block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) or the positive edge of the asynchronous reset (`posedge areset`).'}
