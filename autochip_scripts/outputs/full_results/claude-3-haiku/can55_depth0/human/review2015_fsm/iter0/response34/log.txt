When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. It has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the module waits for the start sequence (1101).
2. `DETECT`: The state where the module detects the start sequence (1101).
3. `SHIFT`: The state where the module shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay.
4. `COUNT`: The state where the module waits for the counters to finish counting.
5. `NOTIFY`: The state where the module notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

The module uses a shift counter `shift_count` to keep track of the number of bits shifted in during the `SHIFT` state. The state transitions and output assignments are handled in the `always` block based on the current state and the input signals.

The module also has a synchronous active-high reset, which sets the state to `IDLE` and resets the necessary internal variables.'}
