After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the desired finite-state machine for the timer. It has the following states:

1. `WAIT_START`: Waits for the input pattern "1101" to be detected on the `data` input.
2. `SHIFT_ENABLE`: Shifts in 4 more bits and asserts the `shift_ena` output for 4 clock cycles.
3. `WAIT_COUNT`: Asserts the `counting` output and waits for the `done_counting` input to go high, indicating the counters have finished.
4. `WAIT_ACK`: Asserts the `done` output to notify the user, and waits for the `ack` input to go high before resetting the state machine.

The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START` when the `reset` input is high.'}
