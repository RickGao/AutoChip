The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The Verilog module provided implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer functionality as per the given specifications. The module has the following main components:

1. **States**: The state machine has five states - `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_DETECT_START`, `STATE_CAPTURE_DURATION`, `STATE_COUNTING`, and `STATE_NOTIFY`.

2. **Inputs and Outputs**: The module takes in the clock, reset, data input, and the `done_counting` and `ack` signals. It provides the `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` outputs.

3. **Shift Count**: The `shift_count` register keeps track of the number of bits shifted in after the initial 1101 pattern is detected.

4. **State Transitions**: The state machine transitions between the different states based on the input data and the current state. The logic for each state is implemented in the `case` statement.

   - `STATE_IDLE`: Waits for the start pattern 1101 to be detected.
   - `STATE_DETECT_START`: Looks for the 1101 start pattern.
   - `STATE_CAPTURE_DURATION`: Shifts in 4 more bits to determine the delay duration, and then transitions to the `STATE_COUNTING` state.
   - `STATE_COUNTING`: Waits for the `done_counting` signal to be asserted, indicating the counters have finished their operation.
   - `STATE_NOTIFY`: Asserts the `done` output and waits for the `ack` signal before resetting to the `STATE_IDLE` state.

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite-state machine control logic for the timer as per the given specifications.'}
