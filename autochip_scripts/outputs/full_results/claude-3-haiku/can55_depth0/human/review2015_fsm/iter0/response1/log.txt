The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer. It has the following states:

1. `WAIT_START`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the start pattern `1101` to be detected on the `data` input. It continuously shifts in the input bits and checks for the start pattern.
2. `SHIFT_DURATION`: When the start pattern is detected, the module enters this state and shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration of the timer.
3. `COUNT`: After the duration is received, the module enters this state and waits for the counters to finish counting.
4. `NOTIFY`: When the counters are finished, the module enters this state and asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out.
5. `WAIT_ACK`: The module waits in this state until the user acknowledges the timer by asserting the `ack` input, at which point it resets to the `WAIT_START` state to look for the next start pattern.

The module also has the following outputs:
- `shift_ena`: Enabled during the `SHIFT_DURATION` state to shift in the duration bits.
- `counting`: Asserted during the `COUNT` state to indicate that the module is waiting for the counters.
- `done`: Asserted during the `NOTIFY` state to notify the user that the timer has timed out.

The module has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START` and resets all the other variables.'}
