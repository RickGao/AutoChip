This Verilog code implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. The state machine has four states: `WAIT_START`, `SHIFT_BITS`, `COUNTING`, and `WAIT_ACK`. 

In the `WAIT_START` state, the state machine continuously shifts in new data bits and checks for the 1101 pattern. When the pattern is detected, the state machine transitions to the `SHIFT_BITS` state.

In the `SHIFT_BITS` state, the state machine asserts the `shift_ena` output for exactly 4 clock cycles, allowing the data path to shift in the duration value. Once the 4 bits have been shifted in, the state machine transitions to the `COUNTING` state.

In the `COUNTING` state, the state machine asserts the `counting` output to indicate that the counters are running. The state machine remains in this state until the `done_counting` input goes high, at which point it transitions to the `WAIT_ACK` state.

In the `WAIT_ACK` state, the state machine asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out. The state machine remains in this state until the `ack` input goes high, at which point it resets to the `WAIT_START` state to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence.

The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START` when the `reset` input is high.'}
