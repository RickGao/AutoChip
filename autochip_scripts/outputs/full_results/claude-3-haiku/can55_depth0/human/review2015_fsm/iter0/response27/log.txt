When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided code is a Verilog implementation of a finite-state machine (FSM) that controls a timer. The FSM has the following functionality:

1. **WAIT_PATTERN**: The FSM starts in this state, waiting for the input data to form the pattern "1101". Once this pattern is detected, the FSM transitions to the next state.

2. **SHIFT_DURATION**: In this state, the FSM asserts the `shift_ena` output for exactly 4 clock cycles, shifting in the duration of the timer.

3. **WAIT_COUNTING**: After shifting in the duration, the FSM asserts the `counting` output to indicate that it is waiting for the counters to finish. It remains in this state until the `done_counting` input is asserted.

4. **NOTIFY_USER**: When the counters have finished, the FSM asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out. It then waits for the `ack` input to be asserted, indicating that the user has acknowledged the timer, before resetting and going back to the initial state.

The FSM has a synchronous reset, which sets the state to the initial `WAIT_PATTERN` state when the `reset` input is asserted.

The code appears to be correct and should compile without any issues.'}
