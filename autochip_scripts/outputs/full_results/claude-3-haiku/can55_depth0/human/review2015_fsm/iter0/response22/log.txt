The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog code implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. The state machine has four states:

1. `WAIT_START`: In this state, the state machine waits for the input data pattern `1101` to be detected. Once the pattern is detected, it transitions to the `SHIFT_BITS` state.

2. `SHIFT_BITS`: In this state, the state machine asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles to shift in the additional 4 bits that determine the duration of the timer.

3. `COUNTING`: In this state, the state machine asserts the `counting` signal to indicate that it is waiting for the counters to finish counting. Once the `done_counting` signal is received, it transitions to the `WAIT_ACK` state.

4. `WAIT_ACK`: In this state, the state machine asserts the `done` signal to notify the user that the timer has timed out. It then waits for the user to acknowledge the timer by setting the `ack` signal high, at which point it transitions back to the `WAIT_START` state.

The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START` and clears the `shift_reg` when the `reset` signal is asserted.'}
