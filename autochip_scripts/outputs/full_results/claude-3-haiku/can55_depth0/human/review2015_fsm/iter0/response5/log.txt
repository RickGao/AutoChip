The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The key changes made are:

1. Added the state definitions and state transition logic in the always block.
2. Handled the shift_ena, counting, and done signals based on the current state.
3. Incremented the shift_count in the SHIFT_DURATION state and transitioned to the WAIT_FOR_TIMER state when the count reached 4.
4. Transitioned to the TIMER_DONE state when the done_counting signal was received, and back to the WAIT_FOR_START state when the ack signal was received.

This should provide the complete and corrected Verilog module for the timer state machine.'}
