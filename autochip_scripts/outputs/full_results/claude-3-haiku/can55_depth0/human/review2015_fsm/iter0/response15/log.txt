This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine for the timer. It has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the state machine waits for the start sequence (1101) to be detected.
2. `DETECT_START`: The state where the state machine detects the start sequence (1101) and starts shifting in the duration bits.
3. `SHIFT_DURATION`: The state where the state machine shifts in the 4 duration bits.
4. `WAIT_COUNTER`: The state where the state machine waits for the counters to finish counting.
5. `NOTIFY_USER`: The state where the state machine notifies the user that the timer has timed out and waits for the user to acknowledge.

The module also has the following outputs:
- `shift_ena`: Enabled when shifting in the start sequence or the duration bits.
- `counting`: Asserted when the state machine is waiting for the counters to finish counting.
- `done`: Asserted when the timer has timed out and the user needs to be notified.

The module has a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to `IDLE`.'}
