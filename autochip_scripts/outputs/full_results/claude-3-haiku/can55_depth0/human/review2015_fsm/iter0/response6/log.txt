The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine as per the given specifications. The key features are:

1. The module has a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to `SEARCH` and initializes the other outputs.
2. The `SEARCH` state shifts in the incoming `data` bit and checks if the pattern `1101` is detected. If so, it transitions to the `SHIFT` state.
3. The `SHIFT` state continues to shift in the next 4 bits, and after 4 cycles, transitions to the `COUNT` state.
4. The `COUNT` state waits for the `done_counting` input to go high, indicating that the counters have finished. It then transitions to the `NOTIFY` state.
5. The `NOTIFY` state asserts the `done` output and waits for the `ack` input to go high, at which point it transitions back to the `SEARCH` state.'}
