The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. The module has the following states:

1. `STATE_IDLE`: The initial state where the module waits for the 1101 pattern to be received on the `data` input.
2. `STATE_DETECT_PATTERN`: Once the 1101 pattern is detected, the module asserts the `shift_ena` output to enable the data path to shift in the 4-bit duration.
3. `STATE_SHIFT_DURATION`: The module waits for the 4 bits of duration to be shifted in, then asserts the `counting` output to indicate the timer is counting.
4. `STATE_COUNTING`: The module waits for the `done_counting` input to be asserted, indicating the counters have finished counting.
5. `STATE_DONE`: When the counting is done, the module asserts the `done` output to notify the user, and waits for the `ack` input to be asserted.
6. `STATE_ACK`: After the `ack` input is asserted, the module resets the state to `STATE_IDLE` and waits for the next occurrence of the 1101 pattern.

The module also includes a synchronous reset that sets the state to `STATE_IDLE` when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
