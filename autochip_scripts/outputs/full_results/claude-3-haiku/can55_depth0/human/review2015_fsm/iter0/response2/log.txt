This module implements the finite-state machine as described in the problem statement. The key features are:

1. The state machine has four states: SEARCH, SHIFTING, COUNTING, and NOTIFY.
2. In the SEARCH state, the state machine looks for the start sequence 1101 and begins shifting in bits.
3. In the SHIFTING state, the state machine shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration of the timer.
4. In the COUNTING state, the state machine waits for the counters to finish, indicated by the `done_counting` input going high.
5. In the NOTIFY state, the state machine asserts the `done` output to notify the user and waits for the `ack` input to go high before resetting to the SEARCH state.
6. The state machine has a synchronous reset that sets the state to SEARCH.'}
