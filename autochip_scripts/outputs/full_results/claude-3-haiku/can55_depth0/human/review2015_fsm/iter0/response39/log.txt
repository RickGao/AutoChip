This module implements the finite-state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. `WAIT_PATTERN`: Waits for the 1101 pattern on the `data` input. When the pattern is detected, it transitions to the `SHIFT_DURATION` state.
2. `SHIFT_DURATION`: Shifts in 4 more bits from the `data` input to determine the duration of the timer. After 4 cycles, it transitions to the `WAIT_COUNTING` state.
3. `WAIT_COUNTING`: Waits for the counters to finish counting by monitoring the `done_counting` input. When the counting is done, it transitions to the `NOTIFY_USER` state.
4. `NOTIFY_USER`: Asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out. It waits for the user to acknowledge (`ack` input) before transitioning back to the `WAIT_PATTERN` state.

The module also has a synchronous active-high reset, which resets the state machine to the `WAIT_PATTERN` state.'}
