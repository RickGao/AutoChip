This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. The state machine has seven states:

1. `S0`: Waiting for the start sequence (1101) to be received.
2. `S1`, `S2`, `S3`: Detecting the individual bits of the start sequence.
3. `S4`: Detected the complete start sequence, start shifting in the duration.
4. `S5`: Shifting in the duration (4 bits).
5. `S6`: Waiting for the counters to finish, assert `done` output and wait for `ack`.
6. Default state: Reset the state machine to `S0`.

The module uses a synchronous reset to reset the state machine to `S0` when the `reset` input is high. The state transitions and output assignments are handled in the `always` block based on the current state and input values.'}
