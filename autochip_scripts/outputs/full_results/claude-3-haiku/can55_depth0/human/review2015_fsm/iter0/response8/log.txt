This implementation includes the following features:

1. The state machine has four states: `WAIT_FOR_START`, `SHIFT_DURATION`, `COUNTING`, and `NOTIFY_USER`.
2. The `data_history` register is used to keep track of the last 4 bits of the input data, allowing the state machine to detect the 1101 start sequence.
3. In the `WAIT_FOR_START` state, the state machine waits for the 1101 start sequence to be detected on the input data.
4. In the `SHIFT_DURATION` state, the state machine asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles to allow the data path to shift in the duration value.
5. In the `COUNTING` state, the state machine asserts the `counting` signal and waits for the `done_counting` input to go high, indicating that the counters have finished counting.
6. In the `NOTIFY_USER` state, the state machine asserts the `done` signal to notify the user that the timer has timed out, and waits for the `ack` input to go high before resetting to the `WAIT_FOR_START` state.
7. The state machine has a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to `WAIT_FOR_START`.'}
