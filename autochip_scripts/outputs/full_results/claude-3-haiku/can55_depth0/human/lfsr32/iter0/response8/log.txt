The corrected Verilog module for the 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1, and synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1` is provided above.

The main changes are:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
2. Inside the `always` block, the `if-else` statement checks for the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`. Otherwise, the LFSR logic is applied to update the bits of `q`.
3. The LFSR logic updates the bits of `q` by shifting the bits and applying the XOR operations at the appropriate tap positions (32, 22, 2, and 1).'}
