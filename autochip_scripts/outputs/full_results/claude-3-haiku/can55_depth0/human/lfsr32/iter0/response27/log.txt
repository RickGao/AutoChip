This Verilog module implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified tap positions. The `always` block handles the LFSR logic, where:

1. On a positive edge of the `clk` signal, if `reset` is active high, the output `q` is set to 32'h1 (the initial state).
2. Otherwise, the LFSR is shifted by one bit to the right, with the LSB `q[0]` being the XOR of the bits at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1.

This implementation ensures that the LFSR correctly generates the desired sequence of 32-bit output values.'}
