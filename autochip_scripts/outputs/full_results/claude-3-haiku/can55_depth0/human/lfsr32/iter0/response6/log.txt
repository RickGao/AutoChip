The provided Verilog code for the 32-bit Galois LFSR is correct and should work as expected. The key points are:

1. The `lfsr` register is used to store the current state of the LFSR.
2. On reset, the `lfsr` is initialized to `32'h1`.
3. On each clock cycle, the LFSR is updated as follows:
   - The most significant bit (MSB) of the `lfsr` is assigned to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - The remaining bits of the `lfsr` are shifted one position to the right.
   - The new LSB is computed by XORing the MSB, bit 21, bit 1, and bit 0 of the `lfsr`.
4. The current value of the `lfsr` is assigned to the output `q`.

This implementation matches the given specification of a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1.'}
