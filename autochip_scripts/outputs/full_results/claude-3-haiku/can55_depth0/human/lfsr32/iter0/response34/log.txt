The completed Verilog module for the given specification is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` which is a 32-bit register that holds the current state of the Galois LFSR.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
3. If the `reset` signal is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`, which is the initial state of the LFSR.
4. If the `reset` signal is low, the next state of the LFSR is calculated by XORing the bits at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1, and shifting the entire 32-bit value one position to the right, effectively implementing the Galois LFSR.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified tap positions and reset behavior.'}
