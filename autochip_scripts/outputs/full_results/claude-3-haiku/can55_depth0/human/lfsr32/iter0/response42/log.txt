The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 32-bit width to hold the LFSR value.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or the positive edge of `reset`.
3. If `reset` is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`, which is the initial value of the LFSR.
4. If `reset` is low, the LFSR is updated as follows:
   - The most significant bit `q[31]` is assigned the value of the least significant bit `q[0]`.
   - The remaining bits `q[30:0]` are shifted one position to the right, effectively shifting the LFSR by one bit.
   - The most significant bit `q[31]` is assigned the result of the XOR operation between `q[0]`, `q[22]`, `q[2]`, and `q[1]`, which are the taps of the Galois LFSR.

This Verilog module implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1, and a synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1`.'}
