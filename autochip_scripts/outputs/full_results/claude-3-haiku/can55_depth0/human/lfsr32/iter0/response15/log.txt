This Verilog module implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The reset signal is active high and synchronous, and it resets the output `q` to `32'h1`.

The `always` block handles the state update on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` signal is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`. Otherwise, the next state of the LFSR is calculated by shifting the bits and XORing the appropriate taps.

The bit positions `31`, `21`, `1`, and `0` are updated based on the LFSR logic, while the other bit positions are simply shifted.'}
