The provided Verilog code implements the specified Moore state machine with two states (OFF and ON), two inputs (j and k), and one output (out). The state machine has the following behavior:

1. When the state is OFF (out = 0):
   - If j = 0, the next state is OFF.
   - If j = 1, the next state is ON.

2. When the state is ON (out = 1):
   - If k = 0, the next state is ON.
   - If k = 1, the next state is OFF.

The state is updated synchronously on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset signal (reset) is an active-high synchronous reset that sets the state to OFF.'}
