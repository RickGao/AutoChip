This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine with two states (OFF and ON), two inputs (j and k), and one output (out). The state transitions and output logic are defined as per the given specification.

The module uses a state register to track the current state, and the reset logic ensures that the state is initialized to the OFF state when the reset signal is active. The state transition logic is defined in a case statement, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the input values.

The output logic sets the output value (out) based on the current state, where out is 1 when the state is ON and 0 when the state is OFF.'}
