The provided Verilog module implements the specified Moore state machine. The key points are:

1. The state is represented by the `state` register, which is updated synchronously on the positive edge of the clock, considering the reset signal.
2. The next state logic is implemented in the `next_state` combinational logic, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals `j` and `k`.
3. The output logic is implemented in the `out` register, which is assigned the appropriate value based on the current state.
4. The parameter declarations for the state values (`OFF` and `ON`) make the code more readable and maintainable.

This module should correctly implement the desired Moore state machine behavior.'}
