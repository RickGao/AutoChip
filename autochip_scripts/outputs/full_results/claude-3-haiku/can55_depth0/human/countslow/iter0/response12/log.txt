The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has three input signals: `clk` (clock), `slowena` (slow enable), and `reset` (synchronous reset).
2. The module has one output signal: `q` (4-bit counter).
3. The module uses an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. Inside the always block:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter `q` is reset to 0.
   - If the `slowena` signal is high, the counter `q` is incremented by 1. If the counter reaches 9 (4'b1001), it is reset to 0.
   - If the `slowena` signal is low, the counter `q` is held at its current value.

This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The counter can be paused using the `slowena` input, and it can be reset to 0 using the `reset` input.'}
