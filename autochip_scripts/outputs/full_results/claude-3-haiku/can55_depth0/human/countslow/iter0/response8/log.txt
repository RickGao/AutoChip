This Verilog module implements a decade counter with the following features:

1. The counter counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10.
2. The `reset` input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.
3. The `slowena` input, when high, indicates when the counter should increment. If `slowena` is low, the counter will not increment.

The module uses a single `always` block to update the counter value `q` based on the `reset` and `slowena` inputs. If `reset` is high, the counter is set to 0. Otherwise, if `slowena` is high, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 9, it wraps around to 0.'}
