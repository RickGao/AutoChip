This Verilog module implements a full adder by performing the following operations:

1. The `sum_temp` wire is assigned the XOR of the three inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`. This gives the sum bit.
2. The `cout_temp` wire is assigned the OR of the three conditions: `a` AND `b`, `a` AND `cin`, and `b` AND `cin`. This gives the carry-out bit.
3. The `sum` and `cout` outputs are assigned the values of `sum_temp` and `cout_temp` respectively.

This implementation correctly computes the sum and carry-out bits for a full adder.'}
