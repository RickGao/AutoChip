This Verilog module implements a full adder by first creating a half adder to add the two input bits `a` and `b`. The sum of the half adder is stored in the `sum_wire` signal, and the carry-out is stored in `cout_wire`.

The full adder is then created by adding the carry-in `cin` to the half adder's sum and carry-out. The final sum is the XOR of `sum_wire` and `cin`, and the final carry-out is the OR of `cout_wire` and the AND of `sum_wire` and `cin`.'}
