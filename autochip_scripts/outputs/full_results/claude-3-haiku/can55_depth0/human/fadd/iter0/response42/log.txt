This Verilog code implements a full adder by using two half adders. The first half adder computes the sum and carry-out of `a` and `b`. The second half adder then computes the final sum by combining the output of the first half adder with the carry-in `cin`. The carry-out `cout` is computed by ORing the carry-outs from the two half adders.'}
