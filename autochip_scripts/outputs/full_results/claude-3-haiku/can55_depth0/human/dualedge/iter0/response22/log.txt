This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate register assignments. The first `always` block captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in the `d_reg` register. The second assignment in the same block updates the output `q` with the value of `d_reg`, which was sampled on the previous clock edge.

This approach effectively behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, as the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, following the input `d`.'}
