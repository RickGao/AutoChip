{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using separate positive and negative edge triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;

            2'b11: q = 1'b1;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the data input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock updates `q_pos`, and the one triggered on the negative edge updates `q_neg`.
3. The final output `q` is determined by a combinational logic block that combines the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` using a case statement.

This approach ensures that the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
