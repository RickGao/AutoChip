The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate `always` blocks, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge of the clock. Here's how it works:

1. The first `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock. In this block, the output `q` is assigned the input `d`, and an intermediate signal `q_neg` is assigned the inverted value of `d`.
2. The second `always` block triggers on the negative edge of the clock. In this block, the output `q` is assigned the value of `q_neg`, which was stored in the previous positive edge.

This way, the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
