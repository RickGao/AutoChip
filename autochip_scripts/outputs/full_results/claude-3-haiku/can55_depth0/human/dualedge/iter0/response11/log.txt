{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.

{'assistant': '```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,

wire clkPosEdge, clkNegEdge;

// Generate positive and negative edge clock signals
assign clkPosEdge = clk & ~clk;

endmodule
```

The key steps are:

1. Generate two signals, `clkPosEdge` and `clkNegEdge`, that represent the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. This is done by using two-input AND gates on the clock signal and its inverse.

2. In the main `always` block, we trigger on both the positive and negative edges of the derived clock signals. On the positive edge of `clkPosEdge`, we update the output `q` with the input `d`. Similarly, on the positive edge of `clkNegEdge`, we also update the output `q` with the input `d`.

This circuit effectively implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are natively supported by FPGAs.'}
