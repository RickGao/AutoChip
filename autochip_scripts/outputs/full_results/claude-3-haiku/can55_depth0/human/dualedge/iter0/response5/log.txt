This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of posedge and negedge clocks. The `temp_q` register is used to capture the input `d` on the negative edge of the clock, and the final output `q` is updated on the positive edge of the clock by comparing the current value of `q` with the value of `temp_q`. This ensures that the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
