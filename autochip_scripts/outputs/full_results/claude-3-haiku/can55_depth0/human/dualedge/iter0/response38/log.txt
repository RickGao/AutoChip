The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate always blocks, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. 

The first always block updates an intermediate register `q_reg` on the positive edge of the clock, based on the input `d`. The second always block then updates the output `q` on the negative edge of the clock, using the value stored in `q_reg`.

This approach allows the circuit to functionally behave like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while being compatible with FPGA implementations that do not support the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list directly.'}
