{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two single-edge triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (clk)
            q = q_pos;
        else
            q = q_neg;
    end

endmodule
```

This module uses two separate flip-flops to capture the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`. The final output `q` is then selected from the appropriate flip-flop based on the current value of the clock.

The key steps are:
1. Declare two internal registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` to hold the values captured on the positive and negative edges respectively.
2. Use separate `always` blocks to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock.
3. Use a final `always` block to select the appropriate value for `q` based on the current clock value.

This approach allows us to implement the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on a single `always` block with a mixed sensitivity list, which is not supported in standard Verilog.'}
