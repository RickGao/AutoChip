This module uses two separate always blocks to achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. The first always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock and updates the `q` register with the input `d` value, as well as the inverted value in `q_neg`. The second always block is triggered on the negative edge of the clock and updates the `q` register with the value stored in `q_neg`, effectively capturing the input value on both edges of the clock.'}
