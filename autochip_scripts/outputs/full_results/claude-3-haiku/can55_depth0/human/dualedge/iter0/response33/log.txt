This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a single-edge triggered flip-flop and a delayed clock signal. The `clk_delayed` signal is created by delaying the `clk` signal by one clock cycle using a separate `always` block. The main `always` block then triggers on both the positive edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `clk_delayed`, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior. The `q` output is updated with the value of `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.'}
