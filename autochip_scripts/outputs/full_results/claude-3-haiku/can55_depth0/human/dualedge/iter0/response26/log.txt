The key points are:

1. We create two separate flip-flop registers, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always` blocks for `q_pos` and `q_neg` update the respective registers on the positive and negative clock edges.
3. The final `always` block uses a case statement to determine the value of the output `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`. The output `q` is set to the input `d` on either the positive or negative clock edge.

This circuit effectively implements the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the FPGA's single-edge triggered flip-flops.'}
