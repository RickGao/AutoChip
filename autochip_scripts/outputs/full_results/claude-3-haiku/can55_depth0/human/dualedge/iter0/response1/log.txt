            2'b11: q = 1'b1;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. In the final output logic, use a `case` statement to determine the value of `q` based on the combined state of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This implementation achieves the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without using the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` construct.'}
