This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate `always` blocks. The first `always` block updates the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock, while the second `always` block updates the internal `q_next` variable on both the positive and negative edges of the clock. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered behavior, as the `q` output will update on both the positive and negative clock edges.

Note that the sensitivity list `always @(posedge clk, negedge clk)` is used to capture both clock edges, even though FPGAs don't have true dual-edge triggered flip-flops. This is a common technique used to emulate the desired behavior.'}
