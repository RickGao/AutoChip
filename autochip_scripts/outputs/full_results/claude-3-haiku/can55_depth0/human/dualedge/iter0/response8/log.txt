The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use a register `clk_prev` to store the previous value of the clock signal.
2. In the `always` block, we check for both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal.
   - If the current clock value is high and the previous value was low, we have a positive edge, so we update the output `q` with the input `d`.
   - If the current clock value is low and the previous value was high, we have a negative edge, so we update the output `q` with the input `d`.
3. This effectively replicates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, where the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal.'}
