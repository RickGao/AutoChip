The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a register `d_reg` to capture the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`. 

The key steps are:
1. Declare a register `d_reg` to store the input `d`.
2. Use a single `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to update both `d_reg` and `q`.
3. The value of `d` is captured in `d_reg` on the positive edge, and then the value of `d_reg` is assigned to the output `q`.

This approach achieves the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without using the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
