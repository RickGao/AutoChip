{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a single-edge triggered flip-flop:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_posedge, q_negedge;

    // Posedge-triggered flip-flop
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_posedge <= d;
    end

    // Negedge-triggered flip-flop
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_negedge <= d;
    end

    // Output mux to combine posedge and negedge flip-flops
    always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
        if (clk)
            q <= q_posedge;
        else
            q <= q_negedge;
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`q_posedge`) and the other on the negative edge (`q_negedge`).
2. Update the values of `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` in their respective always blocks.
3. Use a third always block to combine the outputs of the two flip-flops based on the clock edge, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows you to implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the single-edge triggered flip-flops available on FPGA devices.'}
