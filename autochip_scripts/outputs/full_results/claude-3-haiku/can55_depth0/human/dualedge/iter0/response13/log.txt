This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two regular flip-flops and a combinational logic to select the output based on the clock edge. The `d_ff1` and `d_ff2` registers capture the data input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current clock edge using the `if-else` statement.'}
