The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate always blocks, one for the positive edge of the clock and one for the negative edge. The `temp_q` register is used to store the input data `d` on the positive clock edge, and the output `q` is updated on the negative clock edge using the value stored in `temp_q`.

This approach mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while using the standard single-edge triggered flip-flops that are available in FPGAs.'}
