wire clk_posedge, clk_negedge;

endmodule
```

The key aspects of the solution are:

1. Detecting the rising and falling edges of the clock signal using combinational logic:
   - `clk_posedge = clk & ~clk_negedge`
   - `clk_negedge = ~clk & clk`
2. Using two D-flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge and the other on the negative edge of the clock, to implement the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows you to achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are commonly available in FPGA architectures.'}
