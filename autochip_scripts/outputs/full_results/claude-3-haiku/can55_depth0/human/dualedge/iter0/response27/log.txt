This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The output `q` is then selected based on the current value of the clock signal, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior.

The module contains the following components:

1. `q_pos` and `q_neg` registers to hold the values of the D flip-flops triggered on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. An `always` block that updates `q_pos` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. An `always` block that updates `q_neg` on the negative edge of the clock.
4. A final `always` block that selects the appropriate value for `q` based on the current clock value.

This implementation allows you to achieve the desired behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop on FPGAs, which do not natively support the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
