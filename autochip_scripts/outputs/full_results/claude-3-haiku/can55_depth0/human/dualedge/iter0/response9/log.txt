This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of positive-edge and negative-edge triggered registers. The `q_pos` and `q_neg` registers capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. The final output `q` is then generated by ANDing the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`, which effectively creates the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach works around the FPGA limitation of not having direct support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops, while still providing the desired functionality.'}
