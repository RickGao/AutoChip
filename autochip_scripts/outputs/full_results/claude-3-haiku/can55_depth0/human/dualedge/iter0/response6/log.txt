The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock (q_pos) and the other on the negative edge (q_neg). The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock and the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`. This approach ensures that the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop is achieved, even though FPGAs do not natively support such a construct.'}
