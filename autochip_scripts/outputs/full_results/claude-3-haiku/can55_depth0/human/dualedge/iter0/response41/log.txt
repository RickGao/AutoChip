The provided Verilog module specification describes a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, which is not directly supported in FPGA hardware. To achieve the desired functionality, we can use a combination of two flip-flops triggered on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.

The key aspects of the corrected module are:

1. The `always` block is sensitive to both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk, negedge clk)`).
2. Inside the `always` block, the flip-flop is updated only on the positive edge of the clock (`if (clk)`). This ensures that the flip-flop will capture the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.
3. The `output reg q` declaration ensures that the flip-flop output is a registered (latched) signal.

This implementation provides a functional equivalent to a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available FPGA primitives.'}
