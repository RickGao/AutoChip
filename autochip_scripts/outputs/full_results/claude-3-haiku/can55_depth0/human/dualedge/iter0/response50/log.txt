The provided code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops connected in series. The first flip-flop (d_ff1) captures the input data (d) on the positive edge of the clock, and the second flip-flop (d_ff2) captures the output of the first flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock. 

The final output (q) is then generated by performing an XOR operation on the outputs of the two flip-flops (d_ff1 and d_ff2). This effectively captures the changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

This solution works around the FPGA limitation of not supporting the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list by using two flip-flops in series.'}
