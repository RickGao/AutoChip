This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two levels of synchronization registers (`d_sync1` and `d_sync2`) and an always block that reacts to both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal. 

The first `always` block synchronizes the input `d` signal to the clock domain, and the second `always` block updates the output `q` register based on the value of `d_sync2` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock. This effectively creates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
