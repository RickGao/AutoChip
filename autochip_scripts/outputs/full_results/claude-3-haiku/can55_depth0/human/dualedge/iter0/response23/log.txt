The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The outputs of these two flip-flops are then combined using a logical OR operation to produce the final output `q`.

This approach effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not natively support such a construct. The `always @(posedge clk)` and `always @(negedge clk)` statements are used to update the intermediate flip-flop outputs `q_pos` and `q_neg`, respectively. The final output `q` is then computed by taking the logical OR of these two intermediate values.'}
