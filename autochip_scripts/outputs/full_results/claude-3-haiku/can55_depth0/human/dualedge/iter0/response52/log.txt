{'assistant': 'Here is a Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate positive and negative edge-triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        case ({clk, q_pos, q_neg})
            3'b100: q = q_pos;
            3'b011: q = q_neg;
            default: q = q;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. Then, in the final `always` block, we use a case statement to select the appropriate value for the output `q` based on the current clock edge and the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This approach allows us to create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior without using the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
