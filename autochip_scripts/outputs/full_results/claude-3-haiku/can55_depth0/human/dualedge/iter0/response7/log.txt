This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two regular flip-flops and some combinational logic. The first flip-flop (`d_dff1`) captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock. The second flip-flop (`d_dff2`) captures the value of `d_dff1` on the negative edge of the clock. The output `q` is then selected from `d_dff1` or `d_dff2` based on the current clock edge.

This approach allows us to achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
