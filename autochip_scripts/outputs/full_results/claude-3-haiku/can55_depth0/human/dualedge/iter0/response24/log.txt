The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and one on the negative edge.
2. Combine the outputs of the two flip-flops in a third always block that is sensitive to both the positive and negative edges of the clock. This allows the output `q` to update on both edges of the clock, effectively implementing a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.
3. The `if (clk)` and `else` conditions in the final always block ensure that the output `q` is assigned the value of the appropriate flip-flop (`q_pos` or `q_neg`) based on the clock edge.

This approach allows you to create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the standard Verilog constructs that are supported by FPGAs.'}
