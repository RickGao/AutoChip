{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.

{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a single-edge triggered flip-flop:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_reg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_reg <= d;
    end

    always @(posedge clk, negedge clk) begin
        q <= q_reg;
    end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
1. We use a separate register `q_reg` to store the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. In the second `always` block, we use the `posedge clk` and `negedge clk` sensitivity list to capture the updates to `q_reg` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.
3. The output `q` is assigned the value of `q_reg`, effectively implementing the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows us to create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the standard single-edge triggered flip-flop primitive available in FPGA architectures.'}
