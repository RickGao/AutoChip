{'assistant': 'Here is the Verilog code that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two edge-triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        q = (clk) ? q_pos : q_neg;
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use two edge-triggered flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates `q_pos` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `always @(negedge clk)` block updates `q_neg` on the negative edge of the clock.
4. The final output `q` is assigned based on the current value of the clock signal, using the ternary operator `(clk) ? q_pos : q_neg`. This effectively implements the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows us to achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the primitive edge-triggered flip-flops available on FPGA devices.'}
