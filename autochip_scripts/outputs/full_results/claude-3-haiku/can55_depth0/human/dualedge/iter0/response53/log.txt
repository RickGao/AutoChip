The provided Verilog module specification describes a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, which is not directly supported by FPGAs. To achieve the desired functionality, we can use a combination of a register to store the previous input value and some logic to update the output based on the current and previous input values.

The key points are:

1. Use a separate register `d_reg` to store the previous input value `d`.
2. In the `always` block, update `d_reg` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. Assign the output `q` based on the current clock value and the current and previous input values. When the clock is high, the output is the current input `d`. When the clock is low, the output is the previous input `d_reg`.

This circuit effectively emulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available FPGA building blocks.'}
