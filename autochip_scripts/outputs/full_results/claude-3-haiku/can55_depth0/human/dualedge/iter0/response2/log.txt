The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate always blocks. The first always block triggers on the positive edge of the clock and updates the output `q` and a temporary variable `q_temp` with the input `d`. The second always block triggers on the negative edge of the clock and updates the output `q` with the value of `q_temp`. This effectively captures the data on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
