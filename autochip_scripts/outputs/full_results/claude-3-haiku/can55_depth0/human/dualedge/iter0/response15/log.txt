This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge and one triggered on the negative edge of the clock. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the two flip-flops using a combinational logic block.

The key steps are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative clock edges respectively.
2. In the final output logic, use a case statement to select the appropriate value of `q` based on the current values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This approach provides the functional behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
