The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops and combinational logic. Here's how it works:

1. The `d_ff1` and `d_ff2` registers store the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The first `always` block updates `d_ff1` and `d_ff2` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The second `always` block combines the outputs of `d_ff1` and `d_ff2` to produce the final output `q`. When the clock is high, `q` is assigned the value of `d_ff1`, and when the clock is low, `q` is assigned the value of `d_ff2`.

This implementation effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, as the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.'}
