This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D-type flip-flops and combinational logic. The first flip-flop, `d_ff1`, captures the input `d` on the positive edge of `clk`. The second flip-flop, `d_ff2`, captures the output of the first flip-flop on the positive edge of `clk`. The final output `q` is then generated by XORing the outputs of the two flip-flops, which effectively creates the desired dual-edge triggering behavior.'}
