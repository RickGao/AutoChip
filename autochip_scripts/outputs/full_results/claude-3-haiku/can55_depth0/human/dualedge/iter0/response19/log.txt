            2'b11: q <= 1'b1;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation uses two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge of the clock. The final output `q` is then determined based on the values of the two flip-flops using a combinational logic block.

The key steps are:

1. Declare two internal registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` to store the values sampled on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. Use separate `always` blocks to update `q_pos` and `q_neg` on the positive and negative clock edges, respectively.
3. Use a combinational `always` block with a `case` statement to determine the final output `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This implementation ensures that the behavior of the module is equivalent to a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while using only single-edge triggered flip-flops, which is compatible with FPGA architectures.'}
