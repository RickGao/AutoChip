The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate `always` blocks. The first `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and updates the internal register `q_reg` with the input `d`. The second `always` block is sensitive to the negative edge of the clock and updates the output `q` with the value of `q_reg`. This effectively captures the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
