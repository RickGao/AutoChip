This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock signal.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` registers to store the values on positive and negative clock edges respectively.
2. Two separate `always` blocks to update `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` on positive and negative clock edges.
3. A third `always` block that selects the appropriate value for `q` based on the current state of the clock signal.

This approach allows the module to mimic the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not natively support such a construct.'}
