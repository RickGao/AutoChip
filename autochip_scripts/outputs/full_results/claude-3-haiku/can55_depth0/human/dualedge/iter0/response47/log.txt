{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.

module top_module(

```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.

2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates `q_pos` with the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock.

3. The `always @(negedge clk)` block updates `q_neg` with the input `d` on the negative edge of the clock.

4. The final output `q` is assigned the logical OR of `q_pos` and `q_neg`, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior.

This circuit works around the FPGA limitation of not supporting dual-edge triggered flip-flops directly, by using two separate flip-flops and combining their outputs to achieve the desired functionality.'}
