The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Create two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`q_pos`) and the other on the negative edge (`q_neg`).
2. Use a combinational always block to combine the outputs of the two flip-flops, based on the current value of the clock signal. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

By using this approach, we can achieve the functional behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on a feature that is not natively supported by FPGAs.'}
