The key points in this implementation are:

1. Use two D flip-flops to capture the input data on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.
2. The first D flip-flop (d_ff1) captures the input data on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The second D flip-flop (d_ff2) captures the input data on the negative edge of the clock.
4. In the final always block, the output `q` is assigned based on the combination of the two D flip-flop values, effectively implementing the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows you to create a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not have native support for such a construct.'}
