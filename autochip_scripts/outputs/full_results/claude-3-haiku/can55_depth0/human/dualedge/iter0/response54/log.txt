{'assistant': 'Here is a Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate posedge and negedge clocks:

```verilog

);

    reg q_posedge, q_negedge;

    always @(posedge clk) begin

            2'b11: q = q; // Hold previous value
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use two separate flip-flops, `q_posedge` and `q_negedge`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. The final output `q` is then determined by a combinational logic block that selects the appropriate value based on the values of `q_posedge` and `q_negedge`.

This approach allows us to achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on a construct that is not supported by FPGAs.'}
