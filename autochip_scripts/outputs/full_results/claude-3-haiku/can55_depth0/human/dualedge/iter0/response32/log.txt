{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combinational logic approach:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (clk)
            q <= q_pos;
        else
            q <= q_neg;
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use two separate registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` to capture the input data `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock updates `q_pos`, and the one triggered on the negative edge updates `q_neg`.
3. Finally, we use a third `always` block that combinationally assigns the output `q` based on the current state of the clock. When the clock is high, `q` takes the value of `q_pos`, and when the clock is low, `q` takes the value of `q_neg`.

This approach allows us to create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are commonly available in FPGA architectures.'}
