The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) that implements the given specification. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.

The module starts in state A and remains in this state as long as the input `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.

In state B, the FSM examines the value of the input `w` over the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

The module uses a `count` register to keep track of the number of times `w` has been 1 in the current sequence of three clock cycles. The `count` is reset to 0 when the FSM transitions out of state B.

The `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input `s`. When the count reaches 3 in state B, the FSM transitions back to state A.

The module uses synchronous reset, so when `reset` is high, the FSM is reset to state A, the `count` is reset to 0, and the output `z` is set to 0.'}
