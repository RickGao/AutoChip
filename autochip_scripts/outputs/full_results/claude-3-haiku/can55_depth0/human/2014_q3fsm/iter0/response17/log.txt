The provided Verilog module implements the given finite state machine (FSM) specification. The module has the following features:

1. The FSM has three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`.
2. The module uses a synchronous reset, where the state is set to `STATE_A` and the output `z` is set to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
3. In `STATE_A`, the module transitions to `STATE_B` when the `s` input is 1, and remains in `STATE_A` when `s` is 0.
4. In `STATE_B`, the module examines the `w` input for the next three clock cycles and counts the number of times `w` is 1 using the `w_count` register.
5. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles, the module sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
6. After the three clock cycles in `STATE_B`, the module transitions to `STATE_C`.
7. In `STATE_C`, the module transitions back to `STATE_B` for the next set of three clock cycles.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to satisfy the given FSM specification.'}
