The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given finite state machine specification. It uses three states: `STATE_A` (the reset state), `STATE_B` (the state where the input `w` is examined), and `STATE_C` (the state where the output `z` is set to 1 if the required condition is met).

The module uses the following logic:

1. In `STATE_A`, the FSM remains in this state as long as `s` is 0, and transitions to `STATE_B` when `s` becomes 1.
2. In `STATE_B`, the module counts the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 using the `count` variable. If `count` reaches 2, it transitions to `STATE_C`.
3. In `STATE_C`, the module sets the output `z` to 1 and then transitions back to `STATE_B`.
4. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, transitioning the FSM to `STATE_A` when `reset` is high.

The module uses the minimum number of states required to implement the given specification.'}
