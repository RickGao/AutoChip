The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.

In state A, the module remains in this state as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.

In state B, the module examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM then transitions to state C.

In state C, the module continues to examine the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles, and the output `z` is set accordingly. The FSM then transitions back to state B.

The reset signal is handled synchronously, and the module resets to state A, resets the count, and sets the output `z` to 0.'}
