The corrected Verilog module has the following features:

1. Defines three states: STATE_A, STATE_B, and STATE_C.
2. Uses a state variable 'state' to track the current state and a 'next_state' variable to determine the next state.
3. Maintains a 'w_count' variable to keep track of the number of times 'w' is 1 in the current sequence of 3 clock cycles.
4. Updates the state and 'w_count' variables based on the current state and input 's' and 'w'.
5. Sets the output 'z' to 1 when the state is STATE_C and 'w_count' is 2, indicating that 'w' was 1 in exactly two of the last three clock cycles.
6. Resets the state to STATE_A and 'w_count' to 0 when the 'reset' input is 1.'}
