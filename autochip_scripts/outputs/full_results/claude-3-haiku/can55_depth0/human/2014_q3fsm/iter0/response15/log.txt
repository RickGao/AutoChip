The Verilog module provided here implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. It defines three states: A, B, and C, using the `localparam` construct.
2. It has a `state` register to hold the current state, and a `next_state` register to hold the next state.
3. It has a `w_count` register to keep track of the number of times `w` is 1 in the last three clock cycles.
4. The `always` block for the next state logic ensures that the FSM remains in state A as long as `s` is 0, and moves to state B when `s` is 1.
5. In state B, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles, and sets the `z` output to 1 if `w` was 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles.
6. The `always` block for the state update logic handles the reset behavior and updates the state, `w_count`, and `z` output accordingly.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to solve the problem, as per the instructions.'}
