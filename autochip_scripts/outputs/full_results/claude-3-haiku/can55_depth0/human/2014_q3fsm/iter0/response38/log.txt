The Verilog module provided above implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.

The module has the following functionality:

1. The FSM starts in the reset state A.
2. When the input `s` is 1, the FSM transitions from state A to state B.
3. In state B, the FSM examines the value of the input `w` for the next three clock cycles.
   - If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle.
   - If `w` is not 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 0.
4. After the three clock cycles in state B, the FSM transitions back to state B to continue checking the input `w`.
5. If the output `z` is set to 1 in state B, the FSM transitions to state C.
6. In state C, the FSM continues to examine the value of the input `w` for the next three clock cycles.
   - If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle.
   - If `w` is not 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 0.
7. After the three clock cycles in state C, the FSM transitions back to state B to continue checking the input `w`.
8. The reset signal `reset` (active high, synchronous) resets the FSM to state A and sets the output `z` to 0.'}
