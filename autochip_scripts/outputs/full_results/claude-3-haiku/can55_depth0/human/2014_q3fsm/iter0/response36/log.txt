The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.

- In state A, the FSM remains in this state as long as the input `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.
- In state B, the FSM examines the value of the input `w` in the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM then continues checking `w` for the next three clock cycles, transitioning between states B and C as needed.
- In state C, the FSM also examines the value of the input `w` in the next three clock cycles, similar to state B. The output `z` is set accordingly.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the FSM is reset to state A when the `reset` input is high.'}
