The Verilog module provided here implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. It uses three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`. 

- In `STATE_A`, the FSM remains in this state as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to `STATE_B`.
- In `STATE_B`, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. It keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 using the `w_count` register.
- If `w_count` becomes 2 (i.e., `w` was 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles), the FSM transitions to `STATE_C`.
- In `STATE_C`, the output `z` is set to 1 and the FSM transitions back to `STATE_A`.
- If `w_count` is not 2 at the end of the three clock cycles in `STATE_B`, the FSM remains in `STATE_B`.
- The reset is handled synchronously, where the FSM is reset to `STATE_A` and `w_count` is set to 0.'}
