The finite state machine has four states:
- State A: The reset state, where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`.
- State B: The FSM enters this state when `s = 1`. It then examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.
- State C: The FSM enters this state if `w = 1` in the first clock cycle after entering state B.
- State D: The FSM enters this state if `w = 1` in the second clock cycle after entering state B.

The output `z` is set to 1 in the clock cycle after the FSM enters state D, indicating that `w = 1` in exactly two of the three clock cycles.'}
