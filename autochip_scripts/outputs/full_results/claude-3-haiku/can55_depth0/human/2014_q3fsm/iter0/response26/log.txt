This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. It has three states: A, B, and C.

- State A is the reset state. The FSM remains in this state as long as `s` is 0, and it moves to state B when `s` becomes 1.
- In state B, the FSM examines the value of `w` in the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the FSM moves to state C in the following clock cycle and sets the output `z` to 1. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0, and the FSM remains in state B.
- In state C, the FSM continues checking the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the FSM sets `z` to 1 and moves back to state B. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0, and the FSM moves back to state B.

The module uses a 2-bit state register to keep track of the current state. The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the state to A and set `z` to 0.'}
