The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The provided Verilog module specification has been completed and corrected. The key points are:

1. Defined a state machine with three states: STATE_A, STATE_B, and STATE_C.
2. Used a 2-bit state variable to track the current state and a 2-bit next_state variable to determine the next state.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the always block that updates the state on the positive edge of the clock.
4. Counted the number of clock cycles where w is 1 in state STATE_B and set the output z accordingly in state STATE_C.
5. Ensured that the module resets to the initial state STATE_A when the reset signal is high.

The completed Verilog module should now compile and function as per the provided specification.'}
