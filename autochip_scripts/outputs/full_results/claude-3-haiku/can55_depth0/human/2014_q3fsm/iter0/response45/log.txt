The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has three states: A, B, and C. The state transitions and the logic for setting the output `z` are as follows:

1. The module starts in the reset state A.
2. While in state A, the module remains in A as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to state B.
3. In state B, the module checks the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. It keeps a count of the number of times `w` is 1 in the `w_count` variable.
4. If `w_count` is exactly 2 after the three clock cycles, the module transitions to state C and sets `z` to 1.
5. If `w_count` is not 2 after the three clock cycles, the module resets `w_count` to 0 and remains in state B.
6. In state C, the module immediately transitions back to state B and resets `w_count` to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to solve the problem.'}
