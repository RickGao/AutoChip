The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The completed Verilog module for the given finite state machine specification is as follows:

1. The module has three states: A, B, and C, defined using a localparam.
2. The `state` and `next_state` registers are used to keep track of the current and next state, respectively.
3. The `count` register is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles in state B or C.
4. The `always` block for the state transition logic handles the state changes based on the input `s` and the count value.
5. The `always` block for the `count` register updates the count based on the current state.
6. The output `z` is set to 1 when the FSM is in state C, and 0 otherwise.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to satisfy the given specification.'}
