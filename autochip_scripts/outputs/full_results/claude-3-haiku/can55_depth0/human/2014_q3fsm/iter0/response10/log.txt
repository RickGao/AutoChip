The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The key aspects of the solution are:

1. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.
2. The `s` input is used only in state A to transition from A to B.
3. The `w` input is monitored in states B and C to keep track of the count of `w = 1` occurrences.
4. In state B, if the count of `w = 1` is exactly 2 out of the 3 clock cycles, the FSM transitions to state C and sets the output `z` to 1.
5. In state C, the FSM continues to monitor `w` for the next 3 clock cycles, and if the count of `w = 1` is again 2, it transitions back to state B.
6. The reset logic sets the state to A and resets the necessary variables.

This solution uses the minimum number of states required to implement the given finite state machine specification.'}
