The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The key points of this implementation are:

1. The finite state machine has three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`.
2. In `STATE_A`, the FSM remains in this state as long as `s` is 0, and transitions to `STATE_B` when `s` becomes 1.
3. In `STATE_B`, the FSM checks the value of `w` for three clock cycles, keeping track of the count in the `w_count` variable.
4. If `w_count` reaches 2, the FSM transitions to `STATE_C` in the next clock cycle, and sets the output `z` to 1. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
5. The FSM always returns to `STATE_A` from `STATE_C`.
6. The reset logic sets the state to `STATE_A`, `w_count` to 0, and `z` to 0 when the reset signal is high.'}
