The completed Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has two states: state A and state B. The module remains in state A as long as `s` is 0, and transitions to state B when `s` becomes 1. In state B, the module counts the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 using the `w_count` variable. If `w` is 1 in exactly two out of the next three clock cycles, the module sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The module then continues checking `w` for the next three clock cycles, and the process repeats.

The module also handles the reset condition, where the state is set to A, the `w_count` is reset to 0, and `z` is set to 0.'}
