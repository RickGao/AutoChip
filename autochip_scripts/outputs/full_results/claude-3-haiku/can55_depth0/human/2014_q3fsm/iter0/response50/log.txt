The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. It has three states: A, B, and C. The FSM starts in the reset state A, and transitions to state B when the input `s` is 1. In state B and C, the FSM examines the input `w` for the next three clock cycles and sets the output `z` accordingly.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `state` register keeps track of the current state of the FSM.
2. The `count` register keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1.
3. In state B, the FSM transitions to state C after examining `w` for three clock cycles.
4. In state C, the FSM transitions back to state A after examining `w` for another three clock cycles.
5. The output `z` is set to 1 if `w` is 1 in exactly two of the six clock cycles (three in state B and three in state C), otherwise it is set to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to satisfy the problem statement.'}
