This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. **State A**: This is the reset state where the FSM remains as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.
2. **State B**: In this state, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these cycles, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 in the next clock cycle and then transitions back to state A. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0 and the FSM transitions back to state A.
3. **State C**: This state is entered when `w` is 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles in state B. The FSM remains in state C, continuing to examine `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these cycles, the FSM transitions back to state A, setting `z` to 0.

The module uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state, and a 2-bit `count` variable to keep track of the number of times `w` is 1 in the current set of three clock cycles.'}
