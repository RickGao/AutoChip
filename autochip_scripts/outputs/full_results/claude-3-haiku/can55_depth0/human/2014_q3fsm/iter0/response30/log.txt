The Verilog module provided implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `s`, and `w`, and one output `z`.
2. The module has three states: `A`, `B`, and `C`, represented by a 2-bit state variable `state`.
3. The module also has a 2-bit counter variable `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles in state `B`.
4. In the `A` state, the module remains in `A` as long as `s` is 0, and moves to `B` when `s` becomes 1.
5. In the `B` state, the module examines the value of `w` in the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the module sets `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
6. After the three clock cycles in `B`, the module moves back to `A`.
7. The `C` state is used to handle the case where `w` is 1 in the first clock cycle of the three-cycle sequence in `B`. In this case, the module moves to `C` and then back to `B` in the next clock cycle.
8. The module resets to the `A` state when the `reset` signal is high.

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement.'}
