This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. It has three states: A, B, and C. 

The module starts in state A, where it waits for the input `s` to become 1. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to state B.

In state B, the module starts counting the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1. It does this by using the `count` register. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of the next three clock cycles, the module sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

After the three clock cycles in state B, the module transitions to state C. In state C, the module continues to count the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1, using the same logic as in state B.

The module then alternates between states B and C, continuing to monitor the `w` input and set the `z` output accordingly.

The module also includes synchronous reset functionality, where the state is reset to A and the `z` output is set to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
