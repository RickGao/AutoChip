The FSM has three states:
- State A: The initial state where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it transitions to state B.
- State B: The FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w = 1` in exactly two of these clock cycles, it sets `z = 1` in the following clock cycle and transitions to state C. Otherwise, it sets `z = 0` and transitions to state C.
- State C: The FSM continues checking `w` for the next three clock cycles before transitioning back to state B.

The `counter` variable is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles spent in state B and C.

The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the state to A and setting `z = 0`.'}
