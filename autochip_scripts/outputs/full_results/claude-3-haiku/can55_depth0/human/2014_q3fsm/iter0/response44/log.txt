The finite state machine has three states:
- State A: The initial reset state where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, the FSM transitions to state B.
- State B: The FSM examines the value of `w` in the next three clock cycles. If `w = 1` in exactly two of these clock cycles, then `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. After the three clock cycles, the FSM transitions to state C.
- State C: The FSM continues to examine the value of `w` in the next three clock cycles, similar to state B. After the three clock cycles, the FSM transitions back to state B.

The `count` variable is used to keep track of the current clock cycle within each state. The `z` output is set based on the value of `w` during the three clock cycles.'}
