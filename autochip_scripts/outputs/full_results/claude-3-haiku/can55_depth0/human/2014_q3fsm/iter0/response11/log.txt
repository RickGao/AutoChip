This Verilog module implements the given finite state machine specification using three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`. The module uses a `next_state` logic to transition between the states based on the input `s` and the count of `w` input being 1 in the last two clock cycles (`w_count`). The output `z` is set to 1 when the FSM is in `STATE_C` and the `w_count` is 2'b10, indicating that `w` was 1 in exactly two of the last three clock cycles.'}
