The main features of the code are:

1. The FSM has 4 states: A, B, C, and D.
2. The FSM starts in state A and transitions to state B when the input `s` is 1.
3. In state B, the FSM moves to state C and starts counting the number of `w` inputs that are 1 in the next 3 clock cycles.
4. If the count of `w=1` inputs is exactly 2 in the 3 clock cycles, the FSM transitions to state D and sets the output `z` to 1.
5. From state D, the FSM transitions back to state B and resets the count.
6. The reset logic initializes the state to A and the count to 0, and sets the output `z` to 0.'}
