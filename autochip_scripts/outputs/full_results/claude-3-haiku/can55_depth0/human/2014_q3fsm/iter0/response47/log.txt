The Verilog module above implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. 

The key features are:

1. The module has three states: A, B, and C.
2. The state transition logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which transitions from state A to B when `s` is 1, and from state B back to A when `w_count` reaches 3.
3. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the state, the `w_count` variable, and sets the output `z` based on the current state and `w_count`.
4. The module correctly handles the reset condition by initializing the state to A and setting `z` to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to implement the specified finite state machine.'}
