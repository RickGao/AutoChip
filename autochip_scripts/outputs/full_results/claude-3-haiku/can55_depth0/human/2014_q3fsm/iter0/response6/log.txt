This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has four states:

1. State A: The initial state where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`.
2. State B: The FSM moves to this state when `s = 1`. It then examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.
3. State C: The FSM moves to this state if `w = 1` in exactly two of the three clock cycles. In this case, it sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle.
4. State D: The FSM moves to this state if `w` is not 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles. In this case, it sets the output `z` to 0.

The module uses a 2-bit `state` register to keep track of the current state. The state transitions are handled in the `always` block, which also updates the output `z` based on the current state and the input `w`.'}
