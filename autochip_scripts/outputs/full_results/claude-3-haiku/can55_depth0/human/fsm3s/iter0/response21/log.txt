This Verilog module implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input (`in`), one output (`out`), and four states (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`). The module also includes a synchronous active high reset that resets the FSM to state `A`.

The module has two always blocks. The first always block updates the current state (`state`) based on the next state (`next_state`) on the positive edge of the clock, and resets the state to `A` if the `reset` input is high.

The second always block combinatorially determines the next state (`next_state`) based on the current state (`state`) and the input (`in`), according to the given state transition table.

The output (`out`) is assigned the value `1` when the state is `D`, and `0` otherwise, as specified in the state transition table.'}
