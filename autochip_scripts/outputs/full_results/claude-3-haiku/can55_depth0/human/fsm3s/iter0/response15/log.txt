The provided Verilog module implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. The module includes a synchronous active high reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The main aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in`, and `reset`.
2. The module has one output: `out`.
3. The state of the FSM is represented using a 2-bit register `state`, with the states named `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.
4. The `always` block on the positive edge of `clk` handles the state transitions:
   - If `reset` is high, the state is set to `A`.
   - Otherwise, the state transitions based on the current state and the value of `in`.
5. The `out` signal is assigned the value `1` when the state is `D`, and `0` otherwise, implementing the Moore state machine's output logic.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the provided state transition table.'}
