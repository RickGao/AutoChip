The provided Verilog module specification describes a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:

1. The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. The next state and output are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.
3. The state transition table is provided in the comment section.
4. The module has a synchronous active-high reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The implemented Verilog module includes the following:

1. The state and next_state registers are defined using 2-bit wide registers to represent the four states.
2. The state transition logic is implemented using a case statement that determines the next state and output based on the current state and the input signal `in`.
3. The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, with the reset signal resetting the state to A.

The module should correctly implement the specified Moore state machine with the desired behavior.'}
