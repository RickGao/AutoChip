The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as follows:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q`.
2. The `q` output is declared as a 10-bit register (`reg [9:0] q`), which can represent values from 0 to 999.
3. The main logic is implemented inside an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
4. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter `q` is reset to 0.
   - If the counter `q` is equal to 999, it is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter `q` is incremented by 1.

This Verilog module will correctly implement a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
