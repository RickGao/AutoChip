The completed Verilog module for the given specification is shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has a 10-bit output register `q` to hold the counter value from 0 to 999.
2. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. Inside the `always` block, the code first checks if the `reset` input is high. If so, the counter `q` is reset to 0.
4. If `reset` is not high, the code checks if the current value of `q` is 999. If so, it resets `q` to 0, effectively implementing the 1000-cycle period.
5. If `q` is not 999, it simply increments `q` by 1.

This implementation correctly meets the given specifications.'}
