The corrected Verilog module does the following:

1. Declares a 10-bit output register `q` to hold the counter value.
2. Uses an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks if the `reset` input is high. If so, it resets the counter `q` to 0.
4. If `reset` is not high, the module increments the counter `q` by 1. If the counter reaches the maximum value of 999 (10'd999), it resets the counter back to 0 (10'd0).

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
