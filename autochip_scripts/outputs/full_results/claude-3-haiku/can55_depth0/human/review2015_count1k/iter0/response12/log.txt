This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The counter is implemented using a 10-bit register `q`. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. 

If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 0`). Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1`). When the counter reaches 999 (`q == 10'd999`), it is reset to 0 (`q <= 0`).'}
