The provided Verilog module correctly implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999 with a period of 1000 cycles. The counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 until it reaches the maximum value of 999, at which point it is reset to 0.'}
