This module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key elements of this implementation are:

1. The counter value is stored in a 10-bit register `q`.
2. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
4. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. If the counter reaches 999, it is reset to 0.

This module should correctly implement the specified counter behavior.'}
