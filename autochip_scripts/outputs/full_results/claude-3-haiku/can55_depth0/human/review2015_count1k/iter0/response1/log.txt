The provided Verilog module specification is correct and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset signal, and an output `q` of 10-bit width to represent the counter value.
2. The module uses a single `always` block to update the counter value `q` on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is reset to 0.
4. Otherwise, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1 and then the modulo 1000 operation is performed to keep the value within the range of 0 to 999, inclusive.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
