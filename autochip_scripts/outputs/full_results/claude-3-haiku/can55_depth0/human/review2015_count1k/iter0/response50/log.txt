The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` and `reset`, and one 10-bit output `q`.
2. The counter is implemented using a `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
4. When `reset` is not active, the counter is incremented from 0 to 999 and then reset back to 0.

The completed Verilog module correctly implements the given specification.'}
