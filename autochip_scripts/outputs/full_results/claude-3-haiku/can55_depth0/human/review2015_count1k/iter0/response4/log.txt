The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The module has the following features:

1. It has two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (synchronous reset).
2. It has one output: `q`, a 10-bit register that holds the counter value.
3. The counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles.
4. The `reset` input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.
5. The counter value is updated on the positive edge of the clock.
6. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
7. If the counter value is 999, it is reset to 0 on the next clock cycle.
8. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle.'}
