The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. Removed the unnecessary comma after the `q` parameter in the module declaration.
2. Included the `reset` input as a condition in the `always` block.
3. Incremented the counter value from 0 to 999, inclusive, and reset it to 0 when it reaches 999.

This module will count from 0 to 999 in 1000 cycles, and reset the counter to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
