The provided Verilog module correctly implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

Here's how the module works:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
2. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0.
3. If the `reset` input is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. The condition `(q == 10'd999)` checks if the current value of `q` is 999, and if so, the counter is reset to 0.
4. The output `q` is a 10-bit register that holds the current count value.'}
