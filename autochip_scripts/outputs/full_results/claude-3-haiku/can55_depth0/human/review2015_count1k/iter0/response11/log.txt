This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block checks for the reset condition on the positive edge of the clock. If the reset is active, the counter `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1, and if it reaches 999, it wraps around to 0.'}
