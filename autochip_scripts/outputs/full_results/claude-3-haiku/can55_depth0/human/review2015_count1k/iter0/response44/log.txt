The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has the following ports:
   - `clk`: Input clock signal
   - `reset`: Input reset signal (active high synchronous)
   - `q`: Output 10-bit counter value

2. The counter is implemented using a 10-bit register `q`, which is updated on every positive edge of the `clk` signal.

3. The counter behavior is as follows:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter value `q` is reset to 0.
   - If the `reset` signal is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1, until it reaches 999 (the maximum value of a 10-bit counter). When the counter reaches 999, it wraps around to 0 on the next clock cycle.

This Verilog module implements the desired counter behavior, counting from 0 to 999 inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and a synchronous reset to 0.'}
