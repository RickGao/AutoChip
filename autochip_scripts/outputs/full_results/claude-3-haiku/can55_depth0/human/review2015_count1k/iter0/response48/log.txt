This Verilog module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key points are:

1. The counter is declared as a 10-bit register `q`.
2. The counter is incremented on every positive edge of the clock, using the `always @(posedge clk)` construct.
3. If the reset input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
4. If the counter reaches the maximum value of 999, it is reset to 0 on the next clock cycle.

The ternary operator `(q == 10'd999) ? 10'd0 : q + 10'd1` checks if the counter has reached 999, and if so, resets it to 0, otherwise increments it by 1.'}
