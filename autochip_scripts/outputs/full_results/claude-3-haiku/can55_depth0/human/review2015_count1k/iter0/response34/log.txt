The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module declaration is correct and includes the necessary ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q`.
2. The always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the always block, the following actions are performed:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter `q` is reset to 0.
   - If the counter `q` is equal to 999 (the maximum value of a 10-bit counter), the counter is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is active high.'}
