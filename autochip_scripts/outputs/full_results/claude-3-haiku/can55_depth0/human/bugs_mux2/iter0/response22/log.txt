The bug in the original code was that the assignment statement `out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);` was incorrect. The correct way to implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog is to use a conditional statement (either `if-else` or `case`) to select between the two input values based on the `sel` signal.

In the corrected module, the `out` signal is declared as a `reg` type, and an `always` block is used to assign the appropriate value to `out` based on the value of `sel`. If `sel` is `1`, `out` is assigned the value of `b`, otherwise, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.'}
