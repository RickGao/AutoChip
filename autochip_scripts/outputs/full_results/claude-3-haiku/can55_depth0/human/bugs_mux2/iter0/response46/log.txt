```

The issue with the original code was that the assignment statement `assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);` was using the bitwise AND and OR operators, which would perform the operations bit-by-bit on the 8-bit vectors. This would result in the output `out` being a 8-bit vector where each bit is the result of the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` being selected based on the value of `sel`.

To correct this, we use a `always @(*)` block with an `if-else` statement to assign the correct 8-bit value to `out` based on the value of `sel`. If `sel` is 1, `out` is assigned the value of `b`, otherwise, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.'}
