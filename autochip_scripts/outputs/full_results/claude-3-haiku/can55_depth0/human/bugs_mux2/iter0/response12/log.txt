```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin

```

The issue with the original code was that the assignment `out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b)` was not properly handling the case where `sel` is `1`. In this case, the output `out` should be equal to `b`, but the original expression would result in a bitwise OR between the complement of `sel` and `a`, which is not the desired behavior.

To fix this, we use a Verilog `always` block with a conditional statement to properly assign the value of `out` based on the value of `sel`. When `sel` is `1`, `out` is assigned the value of `b`, and when `sel` is `0`, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.'}
