{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine to detect and decode a serial data stream with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Verifies the start bit is valid (0).
3. `DATA`: Shifts in the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP`: Verifies the stop bit is valid (1) and outputs the received data byte.
5. `ERROR`: Waits for the stop bit to be valid (1) before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module uses a bit counter `bit_count` to keep track of the current position within the byte, and a data register `data_reg` to store the 8 data bits. The `out_byte` output is updated with the received data byte when the `done` signal is asserted.

The module also includes a synchronous active-high reset that resets the state machine, the bit counter, the data register, and the output signals.'}
