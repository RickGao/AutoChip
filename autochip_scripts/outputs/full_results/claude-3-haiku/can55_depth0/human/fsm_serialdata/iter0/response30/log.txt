{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a correct implementation of a finite state machine that can identify correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit.

The module has the following states:
- `IDLE`: The initial state where the module waits for the start bit (logic 0).
- `START`: The state where the module verifies the start bit is valid.
- `DATA`: The state where the module samples the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
- `STOP`: The state where the module verifies the stop bit is valid (logic 1), and then outputs the received byte in `out_byte` and asserts the `done` signal.
- `ERROR`: The state where the module handles incorrect bit sequences, waiting for the next start bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and output registers when the `reset` signal is asserted.'}
