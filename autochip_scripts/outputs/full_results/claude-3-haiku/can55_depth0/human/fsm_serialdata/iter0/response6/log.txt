{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can correctly identify and decode a stream of serial data bits with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. It waits for the start bit, then receives the 8 data bits, and finally verifies the stop bit. If the stop bit is not as expected, it waits until it finds the next start bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module has the following states:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
- `START`: Checking the start bit.
- `DATA`: Receiving the 8 data bits.
- `STOP`: Checking the stop bit.
- `ERROR`: Handling the case where the stop bit is not as expected.

The module uses a `data_register` to store the received data byte, and a `bit_count` to keep track of the current bit position. The `done` output is asserted each time a complete byte is received, and the `out_byte` output contains the received data byte.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset, which resets the state machine and the output registers.'}
