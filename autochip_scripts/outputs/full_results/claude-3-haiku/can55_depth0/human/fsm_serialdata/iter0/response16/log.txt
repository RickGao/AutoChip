{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can receive serial data bytes with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The FSM has four states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Samples the start bit to ensure it is valid.
3. `DATA`: Samples the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `out_byte` register.
4. `STOP`: Samples the stop bit (1) to ensure it is valid, and sets the `done` output when a complete byte has been received.

The FSM uses two counters: `bit_count` to keep track of the number of data bits received, and `sample_count` to ensure the data is sampled at the correct time within each bit period.

The module includes a synchronous reset that sets the state to `IDLE` and clears the output registers.'}
