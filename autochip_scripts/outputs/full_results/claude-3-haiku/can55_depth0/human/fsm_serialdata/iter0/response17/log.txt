{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine that identifies correctly received bytes in a serial communications protocol. The module takes an input `in` which represents the stream of bits, and a synchronous reset signal `reset`. It outputs the correctly received data byte `out_byte` and a `done` signal that indicates when a byte has been received.

The module operates in the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the detection of a start bit (when `in` goes low).
2. `START_BIT`: Verifies that the start bit is valid (still low).
3. `DATA_BITS`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, least significant bit first.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifies that the stop bit is valid (high). If so, it sets the `out_byte` output and asserts the `done` signal.

If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the module will return to the `IDLE` state and wait for the next start bit.

The module also includes a synchronous reset that sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and resets the internal registers.'}
