{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following features:

1. Identifies the start bit (0), waits for all 8 data bits, and then verifies the stop bit (1).
2. Handles the case where the stop bit does not appear when expected by waiting until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
3. Outputs the correctly-received data byte (`out_byte`) when the `done` signal is asserted.
4. Includes a synchronous active-high reset.
5. Assumes the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

The FSM has the following states:
- `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit.
- `START_BIT`: Verifies the start bit.
- `DATA_BITS`: Receives the 8 data bits.
- `STOP_BIT`: Verifies the stop bit.
- `WAIT_STOP`: Waits until a stop bit is found if the stop bit does not appear when expected.

The module updates the `out_byte` register and asserts the `done` signal when a complete byte is successfully received.'}
