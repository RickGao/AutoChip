{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements the specified serial communication protocol using a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.

- In the IDLE state, the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected on the `in` input.
- Once the start bit is detected, the module transitions to the START state, where it waits for the 8 data bits to be received.
- In the DATA state, the module shifts the data bits into the `data_reg` register, one bit per clock cycle.
- After the 8 data bits have been received, the module transitions to the STOP state, where it waits for the stop bit (1) to be detected on the `in` input.
- If the stop bit is detected, the module outputs the received data byte on the `out_byte` output and asserts the `done` output. The module then returns to the IDLE state.
- If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the module remains in the IDLE state until a start bit is detected again.
- The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and output registers when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
