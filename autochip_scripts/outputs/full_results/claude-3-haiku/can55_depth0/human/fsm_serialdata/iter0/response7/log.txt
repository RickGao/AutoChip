{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module takes in a stream of bits, identifies the start bit, waits for all 8 data bits, and then verifies the stop bit. If the stop bit is correct, the module outputs the received data byte and asserts the `done` signal.

The module has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit to be detected.
2. `START_BIT`: Verifying the start bit is valid.
3. `DATA_BITS`: Shifting in the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifying the stop bit is valid.

The module uses a `bit_counter` to keep track of the number of data bits received, and a `data_reg` to store the received data byte. The `out_byte` output is updated when the `done` signal is asserted, indicating a valid byte has been received.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the state machine is reset to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` input is high.'}
