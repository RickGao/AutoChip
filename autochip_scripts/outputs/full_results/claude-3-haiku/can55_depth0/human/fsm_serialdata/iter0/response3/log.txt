{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine that implements a serial communication protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module takes in a serial data stream on the `in` input and outputs the received data byte on `out_byte` when the stop bit is detected.

The module has the following states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Waits for the full start bit duration (1 clock cycle).
3. `DATA`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, with the least significant bit received first.
4. `STOP`: Verifies that the stop bit (1) is present, and if so, outputs the received data byte on `out_byte` and asserts the `done` signal.
5. `ERROR`: If the stop bit is not detected as expected, the module enters the `ERROR` state and waits until the line goes high (1) before returning to the `IDLE` state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the state machine is reset to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
