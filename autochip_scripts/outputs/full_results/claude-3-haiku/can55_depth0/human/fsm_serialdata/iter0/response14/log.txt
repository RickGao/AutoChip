{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.

Here's how the FSM works:

1. **IDLE**: The FSM starts in the IDLE state, waiting for the detection of a start bit (input `in` going from 1 to 0).
2. **START**: When a start bit is detected, the FSM transitions to the START state. It starts counting the bits and shifting the data bits into the `data_reg` register.
3. **DATA**: The FSM stays in the DATA state while it continues to shift the data bits into the `data_reg` register.
4. **STOP**: When the 9th bit (1 start bit + 8 data bits) has been received, the FSM checks if the next bit is a stop bit (input `in` being 1). If the stop bit is valid, the `out_byte` output is set to the value in `data_reg`, the `done` output is set to 1, and the FSM returns to the IDLE state. If the stop bit is invalid, the FSM returns to the IDLE state to wait for the next start bit.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the state machine is reset to the IDLE state and the output registers are cleared when the `reset` input is high.'}
