{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine to identify and process a serial communication protocol with one start bit, eight data bits, and one stop bit. The module has the following states:

1. `STATE_IDLE`: The initial state, waiting for the detection of a start bit.
2. `STATE_START`: The state where the start bit is verified.
3. `STATE_DATA`: The state where the eight data bits are received and stored in the `data_reg` register.
4. `STATE_STOP`: The state where the stop bit is verified, and the received data byte is output through the `out_byte` port. The `done` signal is also asserted when a valid byte is received.

The module includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and associated registers when the `reset` input is high.

The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, and the module processes the bits accordingly. If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the state machine will wait until a valid stop bit is found before attempting to receive the next byte.'}
