{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The key aspects of the design are:

1. The finite state machine has 5 states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and WAIT_STOP.
2. The state machine waits in the IDLE state until it detects a start bit (0).
3. In the START state, it verifies that the start bit is valid (still 0).
4. In the DATA state, it samples the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
5. In the STOP state, it verifies that the stop bit is 1. If so, it outputs the received byte (`out_byte`) and asserts the `done` signal.
6. If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the state machine goes to the WAIT_STOP state until a valid stop bit is found, before returning to the IDLE state.
7. The module also includes a synchronous reset that clears the state machine and output registers.'}
