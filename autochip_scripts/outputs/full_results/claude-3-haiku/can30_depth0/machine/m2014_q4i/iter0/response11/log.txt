The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. Changed the `out` port to be a `reg` type, as it is being assigned a value in the `initial` block.
2. Added an `initial` block to assign the output `out` to the binary value `1'b0`.

This ensures that the output port `out` is correctly assigned a constant value of 0 in the Verilog module.'}
