The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The output `q` is declared as a 3-bit register.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. Inside the `always` block, the following logic is implemented:
   - If the input `a` is 1, the output `q` is set to 4 (binary 100).
   - If the current value of `q` is 6 (binary 110) and `a` is 0, the output `q` is set to 0 (binary 000).
   - If the current value of `q` is not 6 (binary 110) and `a` is 0, the output `q` is incremented by 1.

This Verilog module implements the given Mealy machine specification.'}
