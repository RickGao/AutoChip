```verilog
module top_module(

    wire a1, b1, a2, b2, out1, out2;

endmodule
```

The module `top_module` has two inputs `x` and `y`, and one output `z`. It implements the following logic:

1. The first gate is an OR gate with inputs `a1` and `b1`. `a1` is the AND of `x` and `y`, and `b1` is the AND of `y` and `x`.
2. The second gate is an OR gate with inputs `a2` and `b2`. `a2` is the AND of `y` and `x`, and `b2` is the AND of `x` and `y`.
3. The third gate is an AND gate with inputs `out1` (output of the first gate) and `out2` (output of the second gate). The output of this gate is assigned to `z`.

This implementation matches the provided specification and should work correctly.'}
