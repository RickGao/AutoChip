The completed Verilog code includes the top-level `top_module` and the sub-module `and_gate`. The `top_module` takes the `x` and `y` inputs and generates the `z` output based on the logic described in the problem statement. The `and_gate` module implements a simple AND gate functionality, which is used by the `top_module` to perform the required logic operations.'}
