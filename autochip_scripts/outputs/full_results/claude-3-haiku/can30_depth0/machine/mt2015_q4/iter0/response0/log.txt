The corrected Verilog module implements the logic gate described in the specification. It uses three `and` gates to perform the required operations:

1. The first `and` gate takes `x` as the `a` input and `y` as the `b` input, and outputs `out1`.
2. The second `and` gate takes `y` as the `a` input and `x` as the `b` input, and outputs `out2`.
3. The third `and` gate takes `out1` as the `a` input and `out2` as the `b` input, and outputs the final `z` output.

The module correctly implements the logic gate based on the given specification.'}
