{'role': 'user', 'content': "//  The top module is a simple state machine that has two states, A and B. The state transitions are determined by the input signal 'in'. When the state is A, if 'in' is high, the next state is A, otherwise the next state is B. When the state is B, if 'in' is high, the next state is B, otherwise the next state is A. The state is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk' and reset to state B on the rising edge of the reset signal 'areset'. The output 'out' is high when the state is B and low otherwise.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput areset,\n\toutput out\n);"}

The main changes are:

1. Declared a state register `state` to store the current state.
2. Defined the state parameters `A` and `B`.
3. Added the reset logic in the state update block to reset the state to `B` on the rising edge of `areset`.
4. Implemented the state transition logic in a `case` statement based on the current state and the value of `in`.
5. Added an always block to assign the output `out` based on the current state.'}
