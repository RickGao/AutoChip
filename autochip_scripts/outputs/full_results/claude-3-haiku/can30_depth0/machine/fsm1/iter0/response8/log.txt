The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. The module uses a single state variable `state` to keep track of the current state (either `STATE_A` or `STATE_B`). The state transitions are handled in the `always` block that triggers on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk` and the rising edge of the reset signal `areset`.

The output `out` is set to `1'b1` (high) when the state is `STATE_B`, and `1'b0` (low) otherwise.'}
