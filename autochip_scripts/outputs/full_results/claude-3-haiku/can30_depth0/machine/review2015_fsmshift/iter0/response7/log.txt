The original code had a few issues:

1. The state register was not defined.
2. The state transition logic was missing.
3. The output `shift_ena` was not properly defined.

The corrected code:

1. Defines a 3-bit state register `state` with the appropriate states.
2. Implements the state transition logic based on the given specification.
3. Sets the `shift_ena` output based on the current state.'}
