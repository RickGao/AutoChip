The completed Verilog module implements the state machine as described in the specification. The key aspects are:

1. The state is stored in a 3-bit register `state`.
2. The state transitions are handled in the `always` block for the positive edge of `clk`.
   - If `reset` is 1, the state is set to `B0` (000).
   - Otherwise, the state transitions through the specified sequence: `B0` -> `B1` -> `B2` -> `B3` -> `Done` -> `B0`.
3. The `shift_ena` output is generated based on the current state:
   - If the state is `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, or `B3`, `shift_ena` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `shift_ena` is set to 0.

This module should correctly implement the specified state machine and signal generation.'}
