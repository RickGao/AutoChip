{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register. If the state register is B, the out output will be high, otherwise it will be low.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput out\n);'}

This completed Verilog module implements the state machine as described in the provided specification. The module uses two parameters, `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`, to represent the two states of the state machine. The `state` register is used to store the current state of the state machine.

The `always` block triggered on the rising edge of the `clk` input is used to update the `state` register. If the `reset` input is high, the `state` register is reset to `STATE_B`. Otherwise, the `state` is updated based on the current state and the value of the `in` input, following the state transition logic described in the specification.

Finally, the `out` output is assigned the value of the `state` register, with `STATE_B` corresponding to a high output and `STATE_A` corresponding to a low output.'}
