This Verilog module implements a 4-bit register with the following functionality:

1. The register is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock signal `clk` and the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.
2. When `areset` is high, the register output `q` is set to 0.
3. When `load` is high, the 4-bit `data` input is loaded into the register output `q`.
4. When `ena` is high, the register output `q` is shifted left by 1 bit, with the least significant bit being set to 0.
5. When none of the signals (`areset`, `load`, `ena`) are active, the register output `q` remains unchanged.

The module uses a single `always` block that handles all the logic for the register behavior.'}
