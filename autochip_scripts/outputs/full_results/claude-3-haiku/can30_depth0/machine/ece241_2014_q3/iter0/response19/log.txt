This Verilog module implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer as described in the given specification. The four bits of the output signal `mux_in` are assigned as follows:

1. `mux_in[0]` is assigned the logical OR of the two input signals `c` and `d`.
2. `mux_in[1]` is assigned the constant value `1'b0`.
3. `mux_in[2]` is assigned the logical NOT of the input signal `d`.
4. `mux_in[3]` is assigned the logical AND of the two input signals `c` and `d`.'}
