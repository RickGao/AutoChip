{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a simple counter that increments its output q by one every clock cycle. It has 3 inputs, a clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and an output register (q). The output register is a 4-bit register, meaning it can store values from 0 to 15.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the output register is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active, the output register is incremented by one. When the output register reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it is reset to 1.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (reset input), and `q` (4-bit output register).
2. The module is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal using the `always @(posedge clk)` block.
3. Inside the `always` block, the behavior is as follows:
   - If the `reset` signal is active, the output `q` is set to 1.
   - If the `reset` signal is not active, the output `q` is incremented by 1 every clock cycle.
   - When the output `q` reaches the value 10 (decimal), it is reset to 1.

This implementation correctly implements the desired counter behavior as described in the specification.'}
