{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a 4-bit counter with a shift register. It has 5 inputs and 1 output.

If the shift_ena signal is high, the module will shift the data input (data) into the 4-bit register (q). If the count_ena signal is high, the module will decrement the 4-bit register (q).

The provided Verilog module is correct and can be used as-is. It implements a 4-bit counter with a shift register, as described in the comments. The module has the following functionality:

1. The module is triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
2. If the `shift_ena` signal is high, the module shifts the `data` input into the 4-bit register `q` by shifting the existing bits of `q` one position to the left and inserting the `data` input at the least significant bit.
3. If the `count_ena` signal is high, the module decrements the 4-bit register `q` by subtracting 1 from its current value.
4. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are low, the module does not perform any operation and the value of `q` remains unchanged.

The module is correctly implemented and should compile without any issues.'}
