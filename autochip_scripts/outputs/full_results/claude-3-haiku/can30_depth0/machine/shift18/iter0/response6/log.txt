This Verilog module implements the given specification. It has 8 inputs (`clk`, `load`, `ena`, `amount[1:0]`, `data[63:0]`) and 1 output (`q[63:0]`). The module has a single always block that is triggered by the rising edge of the `clk` input.

The always block has an if-else-if construct. The first if block checks if the `load` input is high, and in that case, it assigns the `data` input to the `q` output. The else-if block checks if the `ena` input is high, and in that case, it uses a case statement to update the `q` output based on the `amount` input, as specified in the problem statement.

The case statement has four case items corresponding to the four possible values of `amount[1:0]` (00, 01, 10, and 11), and a default case that assigns 64'hx to `q`.'}
