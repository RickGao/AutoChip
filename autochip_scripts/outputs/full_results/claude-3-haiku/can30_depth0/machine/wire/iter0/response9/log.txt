This Verilog module implements the specified behavior. It has two inputs, `clock` and `reset`, and two outputs, `data_out` and `valid_out`. The module uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state of the finite state machine (FSM), and an 8-bit counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles since the last reset.

The module has the following states:
- `IDLE`: The initial state, where the counter is reset to 0 and the output signals are set to 0.
- `WAIT`: The state where the counter is incremented and the `data_out` signal is set to 0. The FSM remains in this state until the counter reaches a threshold of 10.
- `PROCESS`: The state where the `data_out` signal is set to 1.
- `DONE`: The state where the `valid_out` signal is asserted to indicate that the data is valid.

The module transitions between these states based on the current state, the clock signal, and the reset signal.'}
