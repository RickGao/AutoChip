This Verilog module implements the specified functionality. It has two inputs, `clk` and `reset`, and two outputs, `data_out` and `valid`. The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to control the behavior of the module.

The module has four states: `IDLE`, `WAIT`, `PROCESS`, and `DONE`. In the `IDLE` state, the module resets the counter and sets the `data_out` signal to 0. When the `clk` signal is asserted, the module transitions to the `WAIT` state, where it increments the counter and keeps `data_out` at 0. Once the counter reaches a threshold of 100, the module transitions to the `PROCESS` state, where it sets `data_out` to 1. The module then transitions to the `DONE` state, where it sets the `valid` signal to 1 to indicate that the data is valid. The module then transitions back to the `IDLE` state to wait for the next reset or clock cycle.'}
