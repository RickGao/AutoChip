The provided Verilog module is correct and should compile without any issues. The module implements a simple 100-bit wide multiplexer, where the output `out` is assigned the value of `a` when the select signal `sel` is 0, and the value of `b` when `sel` is 1.

The `always @(*)` block is used to create a combinational logic block, where the output `out` is updated based on the value of the select signal `sel`. The `reg` keyword is used for the output `out` to indicate that it is a writable register.'}
