The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `out` signal as a `reg` type, since it is being assigned a value inside the `always` block.
2. Used the `always @(*)` construct to create a combinational logic block that assigns the value of `out` based on the value of `sel`.
3. Correctly used the conditional statement to assign the value of `out` based on the value of `sel`. If `sel` is `0`, `out` is assigned the value of `a`, otherwise, `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

This Verilog module should now compile and function as a simple 100-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer.'}
