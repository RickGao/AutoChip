The key changes made in the corrected module are:

1. Defined the state and next_state registers to handle the state transitions.
2. Implemented the state transition logic in the always block with the case statement.
3. Implemented the output logic in the separate always block with the case statement.
4. Ensured the initial state is set to 2'b00 (S) when aresetn is low.

The corrected module should now work as per the provided specification.'}
