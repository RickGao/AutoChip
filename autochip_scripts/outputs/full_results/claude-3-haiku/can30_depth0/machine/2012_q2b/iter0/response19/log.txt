This Verilog module correctly implements the specified combinational logic circuit. It uses the `assign` statements to directly connect the input signals `y` and `w` to the output signals `Y1` and `Y3` according to the given logic description.

The first `assign` statement calculates `Y1` by performing a logical AND operation between the first bit of the input vector `y[0]` and the input `w`. 

The second `assign` statement calculates `Y3` by first performing a logical OR operation on the second, third, fifth and sixth bits of the input vector `y[1] | y[2] | y[4] | y[5]`, and then performing a logical AND operation with the logical NOT of the input `~w`.'}
