This Verilog module implements a 4-bit shift register with the following functionality:

1. The `clk` input is used to synchronize the shift register operation.
2. The `resetn` input is used to reset the shift register to all zeros when it is low.
3. The `in` input is used to load data into the least significant bit of the shift register.
4. The `out` output is taken from the most significant bit of the shift register.
5. The shift register is implemented using a 4-bit register `sr`.
6. On the positive edge of the clock, if `resetn` is low, the shift register is reset to all zeros.
7. Otherwise, the shift register is shifted left by one bit, and the input `in` is loaded into the least significant bit.
8. The most significant bit of the shift register is assigned to the `out` output.'}
