system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a combinational logic circuit that takes four inputs (a, b, c, and d) and produces two outputs (out and out_n). The module uses two wires (w1 and w2) to connect the inputs to the outputs. The first wire (w1) is assigned the value of the logical AND of inputs a and b. The second wire (w2) is assigned the value of the logical AND of inputs c and d. The output out is assigned the value of the logical OR of wires w1 and w2. The output out_n is assigned the logical NOT of the output out. This module is used to combine the inputs a, b, c, and d into a single output out and its complement out_n.
