This Verilog module takes a 16-bit `scancode` input and sets the corresponding output flags (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) based on the provided specifications.

The `always @(*)` block initializes all the output registers to 0, and then checks the value of the `scancode` input in a `case` statement. If the `scancode` matches any of the specified values, the corresponding output flag is set to 1. If the `scancode` does not match any of the specified values, all the outputs remain at 0.'}
