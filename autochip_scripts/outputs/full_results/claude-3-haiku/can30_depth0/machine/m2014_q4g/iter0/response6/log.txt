    assign out = ~tmp ^ in3;

endmodule

The original module had a few issues:

1. The `logic` keyword was missing for the internal `tmp` signal.
2. The logic for calculating the output `out` was not correct. The original code was trying to perform `NOT (in1 XOR in2) XOR in3`, but the correct logic is `(NOT (in1 XOR in2)) XOR in3`.

The corrected module first assigns the result of `in1 XOR in2` to the temporary signal `tmp`, and then assigns the final output `out` to be the result of `NOT tmp` XORed with `in3`.'}
