The original Verilog module was correct and did not have any compilation errors. The provided code correctly implements the required functionality by generating the 5-bit vectors for the negated and positive versions of the input signals, concatenating them into 25-bit vectors, and then computing the bitwise XOR between the two 25-bit vectors.'}
