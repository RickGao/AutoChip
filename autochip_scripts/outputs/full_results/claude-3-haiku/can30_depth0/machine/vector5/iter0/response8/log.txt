The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be completed as shown above. The key steps are:

1. Create the vector of 5 bits for each input signal using the `{5{}}` operator.
2. Compute the bit-wise NOT vector by taking the negation of the concatenation of the input vectors.
3. Create the bit-wise AND vector by replicating the concatenation of the input signals.
4. Compute the final output by taking the XOR of the two vectors.

The completed module should compile and function as expected.'}
