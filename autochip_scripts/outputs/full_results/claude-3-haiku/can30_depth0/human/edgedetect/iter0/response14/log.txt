The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_prev` register stores the previous value of the `in` input.
2. In the `always` block, the module updates `in_prev` with the current value of `in` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `pedge` output is then computed as the bitwise AND of the current `in` value and the negation of the previous `in_prev` value. This effectively sets the corresponding bit in `pedge` when the input transitions from 0 to 1.

This module will correctly detect the 0 to 1 transitions for each bit in the 8-bit `in` vector and set the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output one clock cycle after the transition occurs.'}
