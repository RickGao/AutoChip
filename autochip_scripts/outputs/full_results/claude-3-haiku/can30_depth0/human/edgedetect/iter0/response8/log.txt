The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The module has an 8-bit input signal `in` and an 8-bit output signal `pedge`.
2. It also has a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of `in`.
3. In the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, the following happens:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev` for the next clock cycle.
   - The output `pedge` is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `in` and the bitwise negation of the previous value `in_prev`. This effectively sets the corresponding bit in `pedge` whenever the corresponding bit in `in` transitions from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge transitions for each bit in the 8-bit vector `in` and sets the corresponding bit in the output `pedge` in the cycle after the transition occurs.'}
