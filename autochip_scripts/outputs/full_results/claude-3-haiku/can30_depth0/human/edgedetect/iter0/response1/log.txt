The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input vector `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev`.
   - Computes the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the current value of `in` and the bitwise negation of the previous value `in_prev`. This will set the corresponding bit in `pedge` whenever a 0-to-1 transition occurs in the input.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge transitions for each bit in the 8-bit input vector and outputs the result in the `pedge` register.'}
