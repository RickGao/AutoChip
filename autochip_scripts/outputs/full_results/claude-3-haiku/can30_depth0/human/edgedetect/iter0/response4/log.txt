The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `in` (the 8-bit input vector).
2. The module has one output: `pedge` (the 8-bit output vector, which will be set when a 0 to 1 transition is detected on the corresponding bit in `in`).
3. The module uses a register `in_dly` to store the previous value of `in`.
4. In the `always` block, the module first updates the `in_dly` register with the current value of `in` on the positive edge of the clock.
5. It then calculates the `pedge` output by performing a bitwise AND between the current value of `in` and the negated previous value of `in` (stored in `in_dly`). This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transitions on each bit of the input vector.

This Verilog module should correctly detect the positive edge transitions on the 8-bit input vector and set the corresponding bits in the `pedge` output vector.'}
