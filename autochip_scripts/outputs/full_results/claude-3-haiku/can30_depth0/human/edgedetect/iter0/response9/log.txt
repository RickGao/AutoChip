This Verilog module implements the desired functionality of detecting the positive edge of each bit in an 8-bit vector. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_prev` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` signal.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`), the following happens:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev`.
   - The `pedge` output is calculated by performing a bitwise AND between the current value of `in` and the bitwise negation of the previous value (`~in_prev`). This effectively sets the corresponding bit in `pedge` when the corresponding bit in `in` transitions from 0 to 1.

The module is now complete and should function as expected.'}
