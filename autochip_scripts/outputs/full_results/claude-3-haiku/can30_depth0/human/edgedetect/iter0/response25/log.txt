The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given specification. It uses a one-cycle delayed input signal (`in_d1`) to detect the 0 to 1 transitions in the input `in` and sets the corresponding bits in the `pedge` output in the next clock cycle.

The `in_d1` register stores the previous input value, and the `pedge` output is calculated as the bitwise AND of the current input (`in`) and the negation of the delayed input (`~in_d1`). This effectively detects the bits where the input changed from 0 to 1 between the current and previous clock cycles.'}
