The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality. It uses a one-cycle delay register (`in_dly`) to compare the current input (`in`) with the previous input, and sets the output `pedge` bits when a transition from 0 to 1 is detected on the corresponding bit of the input vector.'}
