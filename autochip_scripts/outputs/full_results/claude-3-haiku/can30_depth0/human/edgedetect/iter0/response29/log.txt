The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It detects the positive edge transitions for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in` and sets the corresponding bit in the output vector `pedge` the cycle after the transition occurs.

The module uses a register `in_prev` to store the previous state of the input vector `in`. In the `always` block, the current state of `in` is stored in `in_prev` on the positive edge of the clock, and the output `pedge` is computed as the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the inverted previous input `~in_prev`. This effectively sets the corresponding bit in `pedge` whenever there is a 0 to 1 transition in the corresponding bit of `in`.'}
