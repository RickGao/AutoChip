The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. The `in_prev` register is declared to store the previous value of the `in` signal.
2. Inside the `always` block, the `in_prev` register is updated with the current value of `in` at the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `pedge` output is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `in` and the inverted previous value of `in_prev`. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit of the input signal and sets the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output.'}
