The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `in` (an 8-bit input vector), and `pedge` (an 8-bit output vector).
2. It declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the `in` vector.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
4. Inside the `always` block, the current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev` for the next clock cycle.
5. The `pedge` output vector is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` vector and the negation of the previous `in_prev` vector. This effectively sets the output bits corresponding to the bits in `in` that have transitioned from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge transitions for each bit in the 8-bit input vector and outputs the result in the 8-bit `pedge` vector.'}
