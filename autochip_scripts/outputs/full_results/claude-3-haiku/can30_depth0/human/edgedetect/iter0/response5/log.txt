This Verilog module implements the given specification:

1. It has the required input and output ports `clk`, `in`, and `pedge`.
2. It uses a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the `in` signal.
3. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, it performs the following:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev`, effectively storing the previous value.
   - Calculates the `pedge` output by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` value and the negated previous `in_prev` value. This detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector.

The module correctly implements the given specification and should not have any compilation errors.'}
