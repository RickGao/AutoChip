This module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The clock is incremented on the `ena` signal, which should be a once-per-second pulse. The `reset` signal resets the clock to "12:00 AM" with higher priority than the `ena` signal.

The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs are 8-bit BCD values representing the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) respectively. The `pm` output is a flag indicating whether the current time is in the PM (1) or AM (0) period.

The module uses an `always` block that is sensitive to the `clk` signal. Inside the block, the clock is incremented when `ena` is high, and the clock is reset when `reset` is high.'}
