The module implements a 12-hour clock with hours, minutes, and seconds counters. The `reset` signal resets the clock to 12:00 AM, and the `ena` signal increments the clock by one second. The `pm` output signal is used to indicate whether the current time is AM or PM.

The module uses a single `always` block to handle the clock logic. The block first checks the `reset` signal and initializes the clock to 12:00 AM if `reset` is high. Otherwise, if `ena` is high, the block increments the seconds, and if the seconds reach 59, it increments the minutes. When the minutes reach 59, the hours are incremented, and the `pm` signal is toggled when the hours reach 12.

The hours, minutes, and seconds are represented as BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digits, each occupying 8 bits.'}
