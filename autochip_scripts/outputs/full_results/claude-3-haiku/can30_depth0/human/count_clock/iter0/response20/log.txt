The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. It uses three 8-bit registers to store the hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively. The `pm` signal is used to indicate whether the time is in the AM or PM period.

The module has three main sections:

1. **Reset**: When the `reset` signal is high, the module resets the clock to "12:00 AM" and sets the `pm` signal to 0 (AM).
2. **Increment**: When the `ena` signal is high, the module increments the seconds, and if the seconds reach 60, it increments the minutes. If the minutes reach 60, it increments the hours. If the hours reach 12, it wraps around to 1 and toggles the `pm` signal.
3. **Rollover**: The module uses BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) representation for the hours, minutes, and seconds, so the values are limited to the appropriate ranges (01-12 for hours, 00-59 for minutes and seconds).

This module should correctly implement the 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator as specified in the problem statement.'}
