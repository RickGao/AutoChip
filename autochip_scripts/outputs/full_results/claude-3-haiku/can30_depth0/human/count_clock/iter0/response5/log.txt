The module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. It has the following features:

1. The clock is clocked by the `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal indicates when the clock should increment (every second).
2. The `reset` signal resets the clock to 12:00 AM and has higher priority than the `ena` signal.
3. The `pm` output is `0` for AM and `1` for PM.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format.
5. The clock increments the seconds, then minutes, and finally the hours, with the AM/PM indicator toggling at 11 AM.

The module correctly handles the clock logic and the required specifications.'}
