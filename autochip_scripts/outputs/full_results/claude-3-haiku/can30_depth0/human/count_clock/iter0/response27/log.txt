This Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The module takes in a fast-running clock signal `clk`, an enable signal `ena` that indicates when the clock should increment (once per second), and a reset signal `reset` that synchronously resets the clock to 12:00 AM.

The module has the following outputs:
- `pm`: A flag that indicates whether the current time is AM (0) or PM (1)
- `hh`: The two-digit BCD representation of the hours (01-12)
- `mm`: The two-digit BCD representation of the minutes (00-59)
- `ss`: The two-digit BCD representation of the seconds (00-59)

The module uses a single `always` block to handle the clock logic. On the positive edge of the `clk` signal or when the `reset` signal is high, the module updates the clock values:

1. If `reset` is high, the module resets the clock to 12:00 AM and sets `pm` to 0.
2. If `ena` is high, the module increments the seconds, minutes, and hours as necessary, wrapping around from 59 seconds to 00 seconds, 59 minutes to 00 minutes, and 12 hours to 01 hour with the AM/PM flag toggling as needed.

The module correctly implements the 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator as specified in the problem statement.'}
