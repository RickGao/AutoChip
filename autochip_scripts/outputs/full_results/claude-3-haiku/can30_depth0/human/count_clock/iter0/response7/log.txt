The module implements the 12-hour clock behavior as described in the specification. It uses a synchronous reset to initialize the clock to 12:00 AM, and then increments the seconds, minutes, and hours accordingly when the enable signal `ena` is asserted. The `pm` signal is used to indicate whether the current time is in the AM or PM period.'}
