The provided Verilog module correctly implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indication. It uses a fast-running `clk` and an `ena` signal to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second). The module handles the following functionality:

1. Reset: When the `reset` signal is asserted, the clock is reset to `12:00 AM`.
2. Clock Increment: When the `ena` signal is asserted, the seconds, minutes, and hours are incremented accordingly, with the AM/PM indication toggled when the hours reach 12.
3. Seconds: The seconds counter ranges from 00 to 59, wrapping around to 00 when it reaches 59.
4. Minutes: The minutes counter ranges from 00 to 59, wrapping around to 00 when it reaches 59.
5. Hours: The hours counter ranges from 01 to 12, with the AM/PM indication toggled when the hours reach 12.

The module uses BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) representation for the hours, minutes, and seconds outputs, as specified in the problem statement.'}
