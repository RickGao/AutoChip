The issues with the original code are:

1. The `shut_off_computer` output was not being assigned a value when `cpu_overheated` was false. To fix this, we added an `else` block to set `shut_off_computer` to 0 when `cpu_overheated` is false.

2. The `keep_driving` output was not being assigned a value when `arrived` was true. To fix this, we added an `else` block to set `keep_driving` to 0 when `arrived` is true.

The corrected code now ensures that all output signals are properly assigned values for all possible input combinations.'}
