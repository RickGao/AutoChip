The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `always` block for `shut_off_computer` has been corrected to assign the value of `1` when `cpu_overheated` is `1`, and `0` otherwise.

2. The `always` block for `keep_driving` has been corrected to assign the value of `~gas_tank_empty` when `~arrived` is `1`, and `0` otherwise.

The key changes are:
- Added `else` clauses to ensure that the output signals are properly assigned in all cases.
- Removed the unnecessary parentheses around the conditional expressions.'}
