{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A large reservior of water serves several users. In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero.

The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput [3:1] s,\n\toutput reg fr3,\n\toutput reg fr2,\n\toutput reg fr1,\n\toutput reg dfr\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a water level control system for a large reservoir. The system has three water level sensors `s[3]`, `s[2]`, and `s[1]` placed at 5-inch intervals, and four output signals (`fr3`, `fr2`, `fr1`, and `dfr`) that control the water flow.

The module has the following behavior:

1. When the water level is above the highest sensor `s[3]`, all the output signals are set to 0, indicating that the input flow rate should be zero.
2. When the water level is between the upper and lower sensors, the nominal flow rate is determined by the water level. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate is increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by `dfr`).
3. When the water level is below the lowest sensor `s[1]`, all the output signals are set to 1, indicating that the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened).
4. The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).

The module uses a state machine to keep track of the water level and adjust the flow rates accordingly.'}
