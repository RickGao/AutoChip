The provided Verilog module `top_module` implements the desired n-bit shift register circuit with the following features:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal.
2. The input `w` is the input to the first stage of the shift register.
3. The input `R` is the value to be loaded into the register.
4. The input `E` is the enable signal for shifting the register.
5. The input `L` is the load signal, which loads the value from `R` into the register.
6. The output `Q` is the output of the flip-flop.

The module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal. The behavior is as follows:

- If the load signal `L` is asserted, the value from `R` is loaded into the flip-flop (`Q <= R`).
- If the enable signal `E` is asserted, the input `w` is shifted into the flip-flop (`Q <= w`).
- If neither `L` nor `E` are asserted, the flip-flop retains its previous value.

This Verilog module correctly implements the desired n-bit shift register circuit.'}
