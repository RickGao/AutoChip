This Verilog module implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting
- `L`: The load signal to load the value from `R`

The module has one output, `Q`, which is the output of the flip-flop in this stage.

The behavior of the module is as follows:

1. On the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), the module checks the value of the `L` signal.
2. If `L` is high, the module loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop, assigning it to `Q`.
3. If `L` is low and `E` is high, the module shifts the value from `w` (the input to the first stage) into the flip-flop, assigning it to `Q`.

This implementation ensures that the module correctly handles both the loading and shifting operations for a single stage of the n-bit shift register circuit.'}
