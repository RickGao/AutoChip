This Verilog module implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. It includes a D-type flip-flop and the necessary multiplexers to handle the loading and shifting of the register.

The module takes the following inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting the register
- `L`: The load signal to load the value from `R` into the register

The module has a single output:
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop, which represents the current state of the shift register stage.

The behavior of the module is as follows:
- On the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), the module checks the value of the `L` signal.
- If `L` is high, the module loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop (`Q <= R`).
- If `L` is low and `E` is high, the module shifts the value from the input `w` into the flip-flop (`Q <= w`).

This module can be used as a building block to construct an n-bit shift register by instantiating it `n` times and connecting the `w` input of each stage to the `Q` output of the previous stage.'}
