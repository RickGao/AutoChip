The provided Verilog module specification defines a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs:

1. `clk`: The clock signal.
2. `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
3. `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
4. `E`: The enable signal for shifting.
5. `L`: The load signal, which should load the value from `R` into the register.

The module has a single output `Q`, which represents the output of the flip-flop in the stage.

The completed Verilog module uses a single `always` block to handle the behavior of the flip-flop. The `if` statement checks the `L` signal, and if it is asserted, the flip-flop's output `Q` is assigned the value of `R`. Otherwise, the `else if` statement checks the `E` signal, and if it is asserted, the flip-flop's output `Q` is assigned the value of `w`, effectively shifting the data through the register.'}
