This Verilog module represents a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module takes the following inputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting the register.
- `L`: The signal that indicates when the register should load the value from `R`.

The module has one output:
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop, which represents the current state of the shift register stage.

The `always` block inside the module defines the behavior of the flip-flop. When the `L` signal is asserted, the module loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop. When the `E` signal is asserted, the module shifts the value from `w` into the flip-flop. On all other clock cycles, the flip-flop maintains its current state.

This completed Verilog module should correctly implement the desired n-bit shift register circuit.'}
