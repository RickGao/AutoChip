The Verilog module `top_module` represents one stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. It takes the following inputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded.
- `E`: The signal to enable the shift operation.
- `L`: The signal to load the value from `R`.

The module has one output:
- `Q`: The current value of the flip-flop.

The logic of the module is implemented in the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. The behavior is as follows:

1. If the `L` signal is asserted, the flip-flop `Q` is loaded with the value from `R`.
2. If the `E` signal is asserted, the flip-flop `Q` is loaded with the value from `w`, effectively shifting the input through the shift register.
3. If neither `L` nor `E` are asserted, the flip-flop `Q` maintains its previous value.

This module can be used as a building block for an n-bit shift register circuit.'}
