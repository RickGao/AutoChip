The provided Verilog module specification describes a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs:

- `clk`: Clock signal
- `w`: Input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: Value to be loaded
- `E`: Enable signal for shifting
- `L`: Load signal

The module has one output:
- `Q`: Output of the flip-flop

The Verilog code implements the desired functionality as follows:

1. On the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), the module checks the value of the `L` input:
   - If `L` is high, the module loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop, storing it in `Q`.
   - If `L` is low, the module checks the value of the `E` input:
     - If `E` is high, the module shifts the input `w` into the flip-flop, storing it in `Q`.

This implementation provides the required functionality for a single stage of the n-bit shift register circuit.'}
