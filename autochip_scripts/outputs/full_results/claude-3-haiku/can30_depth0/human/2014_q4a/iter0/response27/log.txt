```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,

    output reg Q

In this module:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
2. If the `L` signal is high, the value of `R` is assigned to the output `Q`, which implements the load functionality.
3. If the `L` signal is low and the `E` signal is high, the value of `w` is assigned to the output `Q`, which implements the shift functionality.
4. The `reg` keyword is used to declare the output `Q` as a register.'}
