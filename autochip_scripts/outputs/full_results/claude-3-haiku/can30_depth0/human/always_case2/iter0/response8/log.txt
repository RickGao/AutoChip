{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput reg [1:0] pos\n);"}

The provided Verilog module for a 4-bit priority encoder is correct and should work as expected. It uses a combinational `always` block to determine the position of the first high bit in the input vector `in`. The logic is as follows:

1. If all input bits are 0 (i.e., `in` is 4'b0000), the output `pos` is set to 2'b00.
2. If the most significant bit `in[3]` is high, `pos` is set to 2'b11.
3. If `in[3]` is not high but `in[2]` is high, `pos` is set to 2'b10.
4. If neither `in[3]` nor `in[2]` are high but `in[1]` is high, `pos` is set to 2'b01.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, `pos` is set to 2'b00 (as per the problem statement).

This module should correctly implement a 4-bit priority encoder as per the given specification.'}
