{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput reg [1:0] pos\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a 4-bit priority encoder, which takes a 4-bit input `in` and outputs the position of the first high bit in the input using a 2-bit output `pos`. The module uses a case statement to handle all possible input combinations and sets the output `pos` accordingly.

The key points are:

1. The module has a single always block that handles the combinational logic.
2. The case statement covers all possible input combinations (16 in total) and sets the output `pos` accordingly.
3. If none of the input bits are high (i.e., the input is 4'b0000), the output `pos` is set to 2'b00.
4. The default case is included to handle any unexpected input combinations.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the 4-bit priority encoder as described in the problem statement.'}
