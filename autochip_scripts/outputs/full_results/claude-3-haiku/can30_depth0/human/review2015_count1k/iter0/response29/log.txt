The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` to represent the 10-bit counter value.
2. The module uses a single `always` block to update the counter value on the positive edge of the clock.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module first checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the counter value `q` is reset to 0.
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 999 (the maximum value for a 10-bit counter). If it is, the counter is reset to 0.
5. If the current value of `q` is not 999, the module increments the counter value by 1.

This Verilog module correctly implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets the counter to 0 on a synchronous high `reset` input.'}
