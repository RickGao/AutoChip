The module you provided has a few issues that I've addressed in the corrected version:

1. The counter should count from 0 to 999, inclusive, which means the range should be 0 to 999, not 0 to 1000.
2. The reset input is active high synchronous, which means the counter should be reset to 0 on the positive edge of the clock when the reset input is high.
3. I've used a single `always` block to handle both the reset and the counter increment logic.

The corrected module correctly implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999 with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the reset input is high on the positive edge of the clock.'}
