This Verilog module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The counter value is stored in a 10-bit register `q`.
2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0.
4. If the counter value `q` is equal to 999, it is reset to 0.
5. Otherwise, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
