The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the reset input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1, and when it reaches 999, it is reset to 0.'}
