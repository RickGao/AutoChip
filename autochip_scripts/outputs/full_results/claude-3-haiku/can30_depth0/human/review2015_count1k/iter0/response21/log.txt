The provided Verilog module specification can be implemented as follows:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the synchronous reset signal), and one output: `q` (the 10-bit counter value).
2. The counter value `q` is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal, or when the `reset` signal is high.
3. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0.
4. If the `reset` signal is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `q` is 999, it is reset to 0 to start a new counting cycle.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
