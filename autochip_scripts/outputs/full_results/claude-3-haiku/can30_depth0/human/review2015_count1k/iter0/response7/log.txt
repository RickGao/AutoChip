The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the above code represents the completed Verilog module that meets the requirements. The key aspects are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 10-bit width to represent the counter value.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks if the `reset` input is high. If so, it resets the counter `q` to 0.
4. If the `reset` is not active, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 999. If so, it resets `q` to 0 to start the counter over.
5. If the current value of `q` is not 999, the module increments `q` by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is active high.'}
