The Verilog module you provided is correct and should work as expected. It implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

Here's how the module works:

1. The counter value is stored in the 10-bit register `q`.
2. On every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, the following happens:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - If the counter value `q` is 999 (the maximum value), it is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1.

This ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, and resets back to 0 after reaching 999.'}
