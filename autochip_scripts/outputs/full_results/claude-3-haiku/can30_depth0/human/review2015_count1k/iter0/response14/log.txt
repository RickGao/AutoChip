This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key features of this module are:

1. The counter is implemented using a 10-bit register `q`, which can represent values from 0 to 999.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
4. If the counter value `q` is equal to 999, it is reset to 0, otherwise, it is incremented by 1.

This module should compile and function as per the given specification.'}
