The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as shown above. The key aspects are:

1. The counter is defined as a 10-bit register `q`, which can count from 0 to 999.
2. The counter is incremented on every positive edge of the clock `clk`.
3. If the reset input `reset` is high, the counter is reset to 0.
4. If the counter reaches 999, it is reset back to 0 on the next clock cycle.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
