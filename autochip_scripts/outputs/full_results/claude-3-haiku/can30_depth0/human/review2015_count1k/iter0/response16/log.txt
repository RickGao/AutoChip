This Verilog module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Inside the block:

1. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter `q` is set to 0.
2. If the counter `q` is equal to 999, it is reset to 0.
3. Otherwise, the counter `q` is incremented by 1.

The output of the counter is a 10-bit register `q`.'}
