The provided Verilog code implements the next-state logic for the y[2] and y[4] bits of the one-hot encoded state machine. The logic is derived by inspecting the given state transition diagram and using the one-hot encoding information.

For the Y2 signal (corresponding to y[2]):
- When the current state is A (y[1] is high) and the input w is 0, the next state is B (y[2] becomes high).
- When the current state is B (y[2] is high) and the input w is 0, the next state is C (y[3] becomes high).
- When the current state is C (y[3] is high) and the input w is 0, the next state is E (y[5] becomes high).
- When the current state is D (y[4] is high) and the input w is 1, the next state is A (y[1] becomes high).

For the Y4 signal (corresponding to y[4]):
- When the current state is B (y[2] is high) and the input w is 1, the next state is D (y[4] becomes high).
- When the current state is C (y[3] is high) and the input w is 1, the next state is D (y[4] becomes high).
- When the current state is D (y[4] is high) and the input w is 0, the next state is F (y[6] becomes high).
- When the current state is E (y[5] is high) and the input w is 0, the next state is D (y[4] becomes high).'}
