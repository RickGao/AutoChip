The provided Verilog code implements the given Moore state machine specification. The module has the following features:

1. It has two states: `OFF` and `ON`.
2. It has two input signals `j` and `k`, and one output signal `out`.
3. The state transitions are defined in the first `always` block, which updates the state based on the current state and the input signals.
4. The second `always` block sets the output signal `out` based on the current state.
5. The module has a synchronous reset signal `reset` that resets the state to `OFF`.

The Verilog code is complete and should compile without any errors.'}
