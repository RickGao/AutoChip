This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine. The state machine has two states, `STATE_OFF` and `STATE_ON`, and the output `out` is determined by the current state. The state transitions are as follows:

1. When the system is in `STATE_OFF` and `j` is 1, the state transitions to `STATE_ON` and `out` is set to 1.
2. When the system is in `STATE_OFF` and `j` is 0, the state remains in `STATE_OFF` and `out` is set to 0.
3. When the system is in `STATE_ON` and `k` is 1, the state transitions to `STATE_OFF` and `out` is set to 0.
4. When the system is in `STATE_ON` and `k` is 0, the state remains in `STATE_ON` and `out` is set to 1.

The module also includes a synchronous, active-high reset signal that resets the state to `STATE_OFF` and sets `out` to 0.'}
