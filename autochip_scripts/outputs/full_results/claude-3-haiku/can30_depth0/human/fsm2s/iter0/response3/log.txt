This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine specification. The state machine has two states, `OFF` and `ON`, which are represented as an enumeration `state_t`. The current state is stored in the `state` register, and the next state is calculated in the combinational `next_state` logic based on the inputs `j` and `k`.

The reset signal is handled synchronously, where the state is set to `OFF` on the active-high reset.

The output `out` is assigned the appropriate value based on the current state, with `out` being 0 in the `OFF` state and 1 in the `ON` state.'}
