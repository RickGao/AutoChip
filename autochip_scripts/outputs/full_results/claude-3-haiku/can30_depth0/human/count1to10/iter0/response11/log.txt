This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive. The counter is reset to 1 when the `reset` input is high. The counter value is represented using a 4-bit register `q`.

The `always` block runs on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 1 (`4'b0001`). Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle, unless the counter has reached 10 (`4'b1010`), in which case it is reset back to 1.'}
