This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 inclusive. The `reset` input is a synchronous active high reset signal that resets the counter to 1. The counter is implemented using a single `always` block that updates the `q` register on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. If the `reset` signal is high, the `q` register is set to 1. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 until it reaches 10, at which point it is reset to 1.'}
