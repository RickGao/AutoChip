The provided code is a Verilog module that implements a decade counter. The counter counts from 1 to 10, inclusive, and the reset input is active high synchronous, which means that the counter is reset to 1 when the reset input is high.

The main logic of the counter is implemented in the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is set to 1. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 until it reaches 10, at which point it is reset back to 1.

The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.'}
