The given Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states (IDLE, STATE1, and STATE2) and an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected.

The module has the following key features:

1. The state transitions are defined in the `always @(*)` block, which implements the combinational logic for the next state and the output `z`.
2. The state is updated in the `always @(posedge clk, negedge aresetn)` block, which handles the synchronous state update and the asynchronous reset.
3. The module correctly handles overlapping sequences by transitioning back to the IDLE state from STATE1 if the input `x` becomes 1 again, and from STATE2 if the input `x` becomes 0.

This Verilog module is correct and should compile without any issues.'}
