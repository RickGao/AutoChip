The Verilog code provided implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and has 3 states.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that it can detect the "101" sequence even if it is part of a longer sequence like "1101".

The `state` and `next_state` registers keep track of the current and next state of the FSM. The `always` block at the top handles the state transitions on the positive edge of the clock, and the asynchronous reset. The second `always` block handles the combinational logic to determine the next state and the output `z` based on the current state and the input `x`.'}
