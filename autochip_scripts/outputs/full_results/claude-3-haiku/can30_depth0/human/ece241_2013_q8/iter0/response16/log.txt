This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_FIRST_1`, and `STATE_LAST_1`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The module recognizes overlapping sequences by transitioning back to the `STATE_FIRST_1` state from the `STATE_LAST_1` state when the next input is a 1.'}
