The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has an asynchronous negative edge-triggered reset signal `aresetn`.

The state machine has three states: `STATE_0`, `STATE_1`, and `STATE_2`. The state transition logic and next state logic are implemented in the `always` blocks. The output logic is also defined in an `always` block, where the output signal `z` is set to 1 when the state machine is in `STATE_2`.

The module correctly recognizes overlapping sequences and should work as per the given specification.'}
