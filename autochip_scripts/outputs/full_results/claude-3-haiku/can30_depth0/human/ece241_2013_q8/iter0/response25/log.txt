The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses 3 states.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that it will detect the "101" sequence even if it is part of a longer sequence like "1010101".

The FSM has the following state transition logic:

1. In the `IDLE` state, if `x` is 1, the next state is `S1`.
2. In the `S1` state, if `x` is 0, the next state is `S2`, otherwise, the next state is `S1`.
3. In the `S2` state, if `x` is 1, the next state is `IDLE` and the output `z` is asserted to 1. If `x` is 0, the next state is `IDLE`.

The asynchronous reset is handled by transitioning to the `IDLE` state when `aresetn` is 0.'}
