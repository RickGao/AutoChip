The Verilog code provided is a complete implementation of a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and has three states.

The module has the following components:

1. State register: The state of the FSM is stored in the `state` register, which is a 2-bit register.
2. Next-state logic: The next state of the FSM is determined by the `next_state` logic, which is implemented using a case statement.
3. Output logic: The output signal `z` is determined by the current state of the FSM.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences by checking the current state and the input `x` to determine the next state and the output `z`.'}
