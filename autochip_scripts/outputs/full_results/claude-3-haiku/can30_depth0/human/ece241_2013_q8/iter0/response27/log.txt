This module has the following features:

1. It has three states (S0, S1, S2) to recognize the "101" sequence.
2. The `z` output is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected.
3. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset controlled by the `aresetn` signal.
4. The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning it can detect multiple instances of the "101" sequence within the input stream.

The state transitions are as follows:

- If the current state is S0 and the input `x` is 1, the next state becomes S1.
- If the current state is S1 and the input `x` is 0, the next state becomes S2.
- If the current state is S2 and the input `x` is 1, the next state becomes S1 and the output `z` is asserted to 1.
- If the current state is S2 and the input `x` is 0, the next state becomes S0 and the output `z` is deasserted to 0.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the specified Mealy-type finite state machine.'}
