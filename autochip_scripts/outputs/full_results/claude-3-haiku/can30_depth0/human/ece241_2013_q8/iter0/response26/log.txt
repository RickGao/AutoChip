This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has 3 states: `IDLE`, `S1`, and `S2`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected.

The state transition logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the input `x`. The output logic is also defined in the `always @(*)` block, where the output `z` is set based on the current state.

The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal, and the FSM is reset asynchronously on the negative edge of the `aresetn` signal.

This FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that if the input sequence is "1010101", the output `z` will be asserted for the last "101" sequence.'}
