This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The module has an asynchronous negative edge triggered reset signal `aresetn`. The FSM has three states: `IDLE`, `FIRST_1`, and `DETECTED`.

The `always` block for the state update logic updates the current state `state` based on the next state `next_state`, and sets the output `z` based on the current state. The `always` block for the next state logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`.

The module correctly recognizes overlapping sequences, as per the given specification.'}
