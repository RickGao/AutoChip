The provided Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states (`S0`, `S1`, and `S2`) and an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, as specified in the problem statement.

The module uses a `state` register to keep track of the current state, and a `next_state` register to hold the next state. The `always` block that updates the `state` register is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal `aresetn`.

The combinational logic that determines the next state and the output `z` is implemented in the second `always` block, which is sensitive to the current state. The module correctly recognizes overlapping sequences, as required.'}
