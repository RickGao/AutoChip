```

The changes made are:

1. Initialized the output register `q` to 0 on reset.
2. Incremented the counter only when `slowena` is high, otherwise the counter holds its current value.
3. Checked if the counter has reached the maximum value of 9 (binary 1001), and reset it to 0 in that case.
4. Incremented the counter by 1 when `slowena` is high and the counter is less than 9.

This implementation meets the given requirements for a decade counter with a synchronous reset and a `slowena` input to control the counter increment.'}
