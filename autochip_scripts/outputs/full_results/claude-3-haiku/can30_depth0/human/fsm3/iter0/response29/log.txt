The implemented Verilog module correctly implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine. The key features are:

1. The state register `state` and the next state register `next_state` are defined as 2-bit registers to represent the 4 states A, B, C, and D.
2. The next state logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `in`.
3. The output logic is implemented using a simple assignment `out = (state == D)`, which sets the output `out` high when the state is D.
4. The state register update is handled in the `always @(posedge clk, posedge areset)` block, which updates the state register to the next state on a positive edge of the clock, and resets the state to A on an active high `areset` signal.

This implementation should correctly implement the specified state machine behavior.'}
