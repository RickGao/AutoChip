{'assistant': 'Here is the Verilog code for the "top_module" that implements the given Karnaugh map using a 4-to-1 multiplexer and 2-to-1 multiplexers:

```verilog
module top_module (

    wire w1, w2, w3;

    // Implement the K-map using 2-to-1 multiplexers

    assign mux_in[3] = w3;

endmodule
```

The key steps are:

1. Use 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement the Karnaugh map. The expressions for the 2-to-1 mux outputs (`w1`, `w2`, `w3`) are derived directly from the Karnaugh map.
2. Connect the outputs of the 2-to-1 multiplexers to the 4-to-1 multiplexer inputs (`mux_in[3:0]`).
3. The 4-to-1 multiplexer will then select the appropriate output based on the `a` and `b` inputs.

This solution uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers required to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
