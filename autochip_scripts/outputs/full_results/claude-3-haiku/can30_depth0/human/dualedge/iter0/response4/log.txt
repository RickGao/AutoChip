The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge and the other on the negative edge of the clock signal. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock signal.

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Two separate registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` are used to store the values on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always` blocks for `q_pos` and `q_neg` are triggered on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively, using `@(posedge clk)` and `@(negedge clk)`.
3. The final output `q` is assigned using a conditional expression `(clk) ? q_pos : q_neg`, which selects the appropriate value based on the current state of the clock signal.

This approach provides a way to emulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without using the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` syntax.'}
