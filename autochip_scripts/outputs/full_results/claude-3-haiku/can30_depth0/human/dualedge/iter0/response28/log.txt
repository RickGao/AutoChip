The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate registers and an `always` block that samples the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and updates the output `q` on the same positive edge.

The key aspects are:

1. An extra register `d_reg` is used to store the input `d` on the positive clock edge.
2. The output `q` is then updated with the value of `d_reg` on the same positive clock edge.

This effectively creates a flip-flop that responds to both the positive and negative edges of the clock, despite FPGAs not having direct support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops.'}
