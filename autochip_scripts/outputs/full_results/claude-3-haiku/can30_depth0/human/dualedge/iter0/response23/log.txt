The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops and some additional logic. Here's how it works:

1. The first `always` block samples the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in the intermediate registers `d_ff1` and `d_ff2`.
2. The second `always` block uses a conditional statement to determine the output `q`. If the clock is high, `q` is assigned the value of `d_ff1`, which represents the input sampled on the positive edge of the clock. If the clock is low, `q` is assigned the value of `d_ff2`, which represents the input sampled on the negative edge of the clock.

This combination of two D flip-flops and the conditional logic in the second `always` block effectively creates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop that updates its output on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, even though FPGAs don't have direct support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops.'}
