This design uses three separate always blocks to implement the dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior:

1. The first always block updates the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The second always block updates a temporary variable `temp_q` on the negative edge of the clock.
3. The third always block combines the values of `q` and `temp_q` to create the final dual-edge triggered behavior.

On the positive edge of the clock, the input `d` is directly assigned to the output `q`. On the negative edge of the clock, the input `d` is stored in the temporary variable `temp_q`.

The third always block then combines the values of `q` and `temp_q` to create the dual-edge triggered behavior. If `q` is 1 and `temp_q` is 0, the output `q` remains 1. If `q` is 0 and `temp_q` is 1, the output `q` becomes 1. This effectively captures the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available single-edge triggered flip-flops in the FPGA.'}
