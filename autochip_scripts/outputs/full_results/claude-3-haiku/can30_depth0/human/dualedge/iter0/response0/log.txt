{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a pair of single-edge triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;

    always @(*) begin
        case ({q_pos, q_neg})
            2'b00: q = 1'b0;
            2'b11: q = 1'b1;
            2'b01: q = q_pos;
            2'b10: q = q_neg;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. We use two separate flip-flops `q_pos` and `q_neg` to capture the data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always` block for `q_pos` is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock, and the `always` block for `q_neg` is sensitive to the negative edge of the clock.
3. The final output `q` is determined by a combinational logic block that combines the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` based on their current state.

This implementation provides the same functionality as a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, but it uses only single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are natively supported by FPGAs.'}
