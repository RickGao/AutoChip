The proposed solution uses a combination of a positive edge-triggered flip-flop and a negative edge-triggered flip-flop to achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. 

The positive edge-triggered flip-flop is updated on the positive edge of the clock, while the negative edge-triggered flip-flop is updated on the negative edge of the clock. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock signal using a multiplexer.

This approach allows you to emulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available single-edge triggered flip-flops in FPGA architectures.'}
