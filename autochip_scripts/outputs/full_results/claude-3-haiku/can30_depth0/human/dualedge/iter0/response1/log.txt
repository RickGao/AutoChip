{'assistant': 'Here is the Verilog code for a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg clk_prev;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        clk_prev <= clk;
        if (clk_prev ^ clk) begin
            q <= d;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this design are:

1. We introduce an additional register `clk_prev` to keep track of the previous value of the clock signal.
2. In the main `always` block, we check for the condition where `clk_prev` and `clk` have different values, indicating that a clock edge (either positive or negative) has occurred.
3. When a clock edge is detected, we update the output `q` with the current value of `d`.

This approach effectively emulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, without relying on the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` construct.'}
