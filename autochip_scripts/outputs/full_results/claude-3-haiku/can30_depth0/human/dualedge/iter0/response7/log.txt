The proposed solution uses two D flip-flops in series to create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior. The first flip-flop, `d_ff1`, captures the input `d` on the positive edge of `clk`. The second flip-flop, `d_ff2`, captures the value of `d_ff1` on the next positive edge of `clk`.

The output `q` is then determined by comparing the values of `d_ff1` and `d_ff2`. If they are different, it means that the input `d` has changed on either the positive or negative edge of `clk`, and the output `q` is updated accordingly.

This approach effectively simulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the standard single-edge triggered flip-flops available on FPGAs.'}
