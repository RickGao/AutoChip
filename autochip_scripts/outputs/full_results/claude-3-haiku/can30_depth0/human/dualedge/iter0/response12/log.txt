Explanation:

To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops, we can use two cascaded D flip-flops. The first flip-flop (`d_ff1`) captures the input data `d` on the positive edge of the clock. The second flip-flop (`d_ff2`) captures the output of the first flip-flop on the next positive edge of the clock.

The final output `q` is then assigned the exclusive-OR of the two flip-flop outputs (`d_ff1 ^ d_ff2`). This effectively implements the dual-edge triggered behavior, as the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

This approach works because the exclusive-OR operation between the two flip-flop outputs will produce a high output whenever the two inputs differ, which happens on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.'}
