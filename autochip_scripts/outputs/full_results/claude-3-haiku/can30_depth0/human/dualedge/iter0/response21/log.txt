```

In this implementation, we use two positive-edge triggered flip-flops to capture the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`. The `q_pos` and `q_neg` registers store the input values on the positive and negative edges, respectively.

The final output `q` is then determined by a combinational logic block that examines the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` and sets the output accordingly. This effectively implements the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
