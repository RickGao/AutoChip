This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a single-edge triggered flip-flop and some additional logic. The key steps are:

1. Store the input `d` in a temporary register `d_reg` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. Use a ternary operator `(clk ? d : d_reg)` to select between the current input `d` and the stored value `d_reg` based on the current clock edge. This effectively toggles the output `q` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

The module uses the legal sensitivity list `@(posedge clk)` to capture the clock edge and update the internal state accordingly.'}
