This implementation creates two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock signal, effectively mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

The key aspects are:

1. Two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, are created and updated on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The final output `q` is assigned based on the current state of the clock signal, selecting either `q_pos` or `q_neg`.
3. This approach works around the FPGA limitation of not supporting dual-edge triggered flip-flops directly.'}
