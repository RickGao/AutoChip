This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge and the other on the negative edge of the clock. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock.

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Two flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, are used to store the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always` block with the sensitivity list `@(posedge clk)` updates `q_pos` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `always` block with the sensitivity list `@(negedge clk)` updates `q_neg` on the negative edge of the clock.
4. The final `always` block with the sensitivity list `@(posedge clk or negedge clk)` selects the appropriate value from `q_pos` or `q_neg` based on the current state of the clock and assigns it to the output `q`.

This approach effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while using only single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are natively supported by FPGAs.'}
