The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate `always` blocks, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and one triggered on the negative edge of the clock. The `temp_q` register is used to store the value of the input `d` on the negative edge, and the final value of `q` is determined by a third `always` block that selects between the current value of `q` and the value of `temp_q` based on the clock edge.

This approach ensures that the flip-flop behaves as a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while still being compatible with FPGA architectures that do not support dual-edge triggering directly.'}
