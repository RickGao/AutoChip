The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of positive and negative edge-triggered processes. The key steps are:

1. Store the input data `d` in the register `d_reg` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. Update the output `q` with the value of `q_neg` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. Update the internal register `q_neg` with the value of `d_reg` on the negative edge of the clock.

This way, the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
