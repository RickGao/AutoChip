The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops, `d_ff1` and `d_ff2`, which are clocked on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. 

The first flip-flop, `d_ff1`, simply stores the input `d` on the positive edge of `clk`. The second flip-flop, `d_ff2`, stores the value of `d_ff1` on the positive edge of `clk`. 

The output `q` is then assigned the XOR of `d_ff1` and `d_ff2`. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered behavior, where the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal `clk`.

This approach is a common technique used to implement dual-edge triggered behavior on FPGA platforms, which typically do not have native support for such flip-flops.'}
