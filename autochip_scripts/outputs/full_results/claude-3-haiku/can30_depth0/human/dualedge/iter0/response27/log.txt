The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate `always` blocks, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge of the clock. The first `always` block captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in the temporary register `temp_q`. The second `always` block then assigns the value of `temp_q` to the output `q` on the negative edge of the clock, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach simulates the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without violating the FPGA constraint of not allowing `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` as a legal sensitivity list.'}
