The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate always blocks, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge of the clock.

In the first always block, the input `d` is assigned to the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock. Additionally, the value of `d` is also stored in the temporary variable `temp_q`.

In the second always block, the value of `temp_q` is assigned to the output `q` on the negative edge of the clock. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior, where the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

This approach is necessary because FPGA devices do not natively support dual-edge triggered flip-flops. By using two separate always blocks, we can achieve the desired functionality without relying on the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
