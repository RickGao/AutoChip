This Verilog code implements the given finite state machine circuit. The key aspects are:

1. Three D flip-flops to store the internal state.
2. Combinational logic to generate the next state based on the input `x` and the current state.
3. An XNOR gate to generate the output `z` based on the three flip-flop outputs.
4. The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop with complementary outputs.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops is not explicitly shown, but it is assumed that the flip-flops are initially in the reset state (all outputs are 0) before the circuit starts operation.'}
