The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement. It consists of the following components:

1. `top_module`: This is the top-level module that instantiates the D flip-flops and implements the combinational logic.
2. `dff`: This is a module that represents a D flip-flop with both the output (`q`) and its complement (`q_n`) signals.

The `top_module` performs the following operations:

- Instantiates three D flip-flops (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`) to store the state of the finite state machine.
- Implements the XOR, AND, and OR gates as specified in the problem statement, using the input `x` and the outputs of the D flip-flops.
- Implements the final XNOR gate to produce the output `z`.

The `dff` module simply implements a D flip-flop, with the output and its complement being updated on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
