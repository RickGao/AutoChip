The Verilog module above implements the described finite state machine circuit. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The module has three internal registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.

2. The `x_xor`, `x_and`, and `x_or` signals are the outputs of the XOR, AND, and OR gates respectively, with the appropriate connections to the flip-flop outputs.

3. The `always` block on the positive edge of the clock updates the flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` with the corresponding gate outputs.

4. The `z` output is the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs, as described in the problem statement.

The module should correctly implement the specified finite state machine circuit.'}
