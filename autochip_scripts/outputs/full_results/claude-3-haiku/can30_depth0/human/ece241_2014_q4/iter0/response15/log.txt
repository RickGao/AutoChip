This Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has three D flip-flops (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`) to store the intermediate states.
2. The combinational logic is implemented using the `assign` statements:
   - `xor_out` is the XOR of the input `x` and the first flip-flop output `q1`.
   - `and_out` is the AND of the input `x` and the complement of the second flip-flop output `~q2`.
   - `or_out` is the OR of the input `x` and the complement of the third flip-flop output `~q3`.
3. The three-input XNOR gate is implemented using the `assign` statement `z = ~(xor_out ^ and_out ^ or_out)`.
4. The sequential logic for updating the flip-flops is implemented in the `always` block, which triggers on the positive edge of the clock `clk`.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops is not explicitly specified in the code, but it is assumed that the flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins operation.'}
