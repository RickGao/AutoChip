The Verilog code above implements the given finite state machine circuit. The key elements are:

1. Three D flip-flops (d1, d2, d3) that store the current state of the machine.
2. The input `x` is fed into three different gates: XOR, AND, and OR, whose outputs are connected to the D inputs of the respective flip-flops.
3. The complement of each flip-flop's output is also generated and used as the second input to the AND and OR gates.
4. The three flip-flop outputs are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is the final `z` output.
5. The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop implementation that updates the `q` and `q_bar` outputs on the positive edge of the clock.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the given finite state machine circuit.'}
