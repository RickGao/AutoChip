The corrected Verilog module includes the following:

1. Declarations of the necessary wires for the flip-flop outputs and their complemented values.
2. Instantiation of three D flip-flop modules, each with the correct input and output connections as described in the problem statement.
3. The assignment of the XNOR gate output to the `z` output port.
4. The definition of the `D_flip_flop` module, which has the appropriate logic to update the `q` and `q_bar` outputs based on the `d` input on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
