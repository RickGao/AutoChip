The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the top-level `top_module` that instantiates three D flip-flops and the necessary logic gates. The `dff` module implements the D flip-flop behavior.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The three D flip-flops are instantiated using the `dff` module, with their inputs and outputs connected to the appropriate logic gates.
2. The logic gates are implemented using Verilog assign statements, with the XOR, AND, and OR gates feeding the corresponding D flip-flop inputs.
3. The final XNOR gate is implemented using the `~(q1 ^ q2 ^ q3)` expression, which computes the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs.
4. The `dff` module implements the D flip-flop behavior, with the `q` and `q_n` outputs representing the flip-flop value and its complement, respectively.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the described finite state machine circuit.'}
