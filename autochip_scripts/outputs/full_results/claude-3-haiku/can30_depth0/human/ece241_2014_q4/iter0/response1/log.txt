The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. Here's how the code works:

1. The module `top_module` has two inputs: `clk` and `x`, and one output: `z`.
2. It declares three internal registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to hold the outputs of the D flip-flops.
3. The `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out` signals are used to connect the input `x` to the respective gates (XOR, AND, and OR).
4. The `always` block on the positive edge of the clock updates the D flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` with the corresponding gate outputs.
5. The `z` output is assigned the result of the XNOR operation on the three flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.

This Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
