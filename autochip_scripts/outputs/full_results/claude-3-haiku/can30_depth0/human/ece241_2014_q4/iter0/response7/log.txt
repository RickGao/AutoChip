The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit as described. The key features are:

1. Declaration of the three D flip-flop output registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
2. Combinational logic for the XOR, AND, and OR gates using the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs.
3. Assignment of the flip-flop inputs in the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock `clk`.
4. The XNOR gate that computes the final output `z` using the three flip-flop outputs.

The module should correctly implement the desired finite state machine circuit.'}
