The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It consists of a top-level `top_module` that instantiates three D flip-flops and an XNOR gate to produce the output `z`.

The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop implementation, which updates the `q` and `q_bar` outputs on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

In the `top_module`, the three D flip-flops are connected as follows:
1. The first flip-flop (`d1`) takes the XOR of the input `x` and its own output `q1` as the data input.
2. The second flip-flop (`d2`) takes the AND of the input `x` and the complemented output `q2_bar` as the data input.
3. The third flip-flop (`d3`) takes the OR of the input `x` and the complemented output `q3_bar` as the data input.

The outputs of the three flip-flops are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is assigned to the `z` output of the `top_module`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
