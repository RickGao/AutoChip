The corrected Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement. It includes the following components:

1. Three D flip-flops (dff1, dff2, dff3) that store the current state of the machine.
2. Three logic gates (XOR, AND, OR) that generate the next state values based on the current input `x` and the current state.
3. An XNOR gate that computes the output `z` based on the current state.
4. A separate D flip-flop module that implements the D flip-flop behavior.

The D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins, as specified in the problem statement.'}
