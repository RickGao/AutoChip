This 32-bit Galois LFSR has taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The reset is active high synchronous and resets the output `q` to `32'h1`. The module updates the shift register in the `always` block on the positive edge of the clock. If the `reset` input is high, the register is set to `32'h1`. Otherwise, the register is updated according to the Galois LFSR logic, where the leftmost bit is XORed with the tapped bits and shifted into the rightmost position, and the other bits are shifted one position to the right.'}
