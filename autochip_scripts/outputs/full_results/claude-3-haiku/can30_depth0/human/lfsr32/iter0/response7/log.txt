This Verilog module implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The `reset` signal is active high synchronous and resets the output `q` to `32'h1`.

The `always` block handles the LFSR logic. On a positive edge of the `clk` signal, the module checks if the `reset` signal is high. If so, it resets the output `q` to `32'h1`. Otherwise, it updates the LFSR by shifting the contents of `q` one bit to the right, and computing the new least significant bit as the XOR of the most significant bit, bit 21, bit 1, and the current least significant bit.'}
