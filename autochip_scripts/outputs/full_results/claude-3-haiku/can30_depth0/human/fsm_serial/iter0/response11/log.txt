{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, and checks for the stop bit (1).
3. `DATA`: Verifies that the stop bit is present.
4. `STOP`: Resets the FSM to the `IDLE` state.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset, and sets the `done` output signal high when a byte is received successfully.'}
