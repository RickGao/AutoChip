{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The completed Verilog module covers the following:

1. Defines the necessary states for the finite state machine (IDLE, START, DATA, STOP).
2. Initializes the state, bit_count, data_register, and done signal on reset.
3. Implements the state machine logic to handle the serial data stream:
   - IDLE state waits for the start bit (0) to arrive.
   - START state checks the start bit and transitions to DATA state if correct.
   - DATA state shifts in the 8 data bits, one per cycle.
   - STOP state checks for the expected stop bit (1) and sets the done signal if correct.
   - If the stop bit is not as expected, the FSM transitions back to IDLE to wait for the next start bit.
4. The least significant bit is received first, as per the serial protocol specification.

This module should correctly identify and extract the data bytes from the given serial data stream.'}
