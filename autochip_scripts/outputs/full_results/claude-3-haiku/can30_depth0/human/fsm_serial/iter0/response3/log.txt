{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset.

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The module has the following features:

1. It has three main states: IDLE, START, and STOP.
2. In the IDLE state, it waits for the detection of a start bit (0).
3. In the START state, it shifts in the 8 data bits and then checks for the stop bit (1).
4. If the stop bit is detected, it transitions to the STOP state to verify the stop bit.
5. If the stop bit is not detected, it returns to the IDLE state to wait for the next start bit.
6. The module also includes a synchronous active-high reset, which resets the state machine and the data register.
7. The `done` output is set high when a complete byte has been received successfully.

Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, so the data bits are shifted in accordingly.'}
