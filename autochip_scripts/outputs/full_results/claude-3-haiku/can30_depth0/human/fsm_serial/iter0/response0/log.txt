{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received from a serial communication stream. It has the following functionality:

1. The module starts in the `IDLE` state, waiting for a start bit (0) to be detected on the `in` input.
2. When a start bit is detected, the module transitions to the `START` state, where it verifies that the start bit is valid (still 0).
3. After the start bit is verified, the module transitions to the `DATA` state, where it shifts in the 8 data bits, least significant bit first.
4. Once all 8 data bits have been received, the module transitions to the `STOP` state, where it verifies that the stop bit (1) is present.
5. If the stop bit is valid, the module sets the `done` output to 1 and returns to the `IDLE` state, ready to receive the next byte.
6. If the stop bit is not valid, the module returns to the `IDLE` state without setting the `done` output, waiting for the next valid start bit.
7. The module also includes a synchronous reset signal that returns the FSM to the `IDLE` state and resets the internal registers.'}
