{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has three states:

1. **IDLE**: The module waits for the start bit (0) to be received.
2. **RECEIVING**: The module shifts in the 8 data bits, one at a time.
3. **WAIT_STOP**: The module waits for the stop bit (1) to be received.

The module uses a `bit_count` register to keep track of how many data bits have been received, and a `data` register to store the received data. If the stop bit is correctly received, the `done` output is set high to indicate that a complete byte has been received. If the stop bit is not received when expected, the module waits in the `WAIT_STOP` state until a stop bit is found before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset input `reset`, which resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and clears the `data` and `bit_count` registers.'}
