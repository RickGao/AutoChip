{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module above implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit.

The module has the following states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START_BIT`: Verifies the start bit is valid.
3. `DATA_BITS`: Samples the 8 data bits, least significant bit first.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifies the stop bit (1) is present.

The module also includes a synchronous reset that clears the state machine and resets the internal variables.

When a complete byte is successfully received, the `done` output is set high to indicate the data is available. The `data_buffer` variable stores the received 8-bit data.'}
