{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states:

1. `WAIT_START`: The FSM waits for the start bit (0) to be detected on the `in` input.
2. `RECEIVE_DATA`: Once the start bit is detected, the FSM receives the 8 data bits and stores them in the `data_reg` register.
3. `WAIT_STOP`: After the 8 data bits have been received, the FSM waits for the stop bit (1) to be detected on the `in` input.
4. `DONE`: When the stop bit is detected, the FSM sets the `done` output to 1, indicating that a byte has been successfully received.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset, which resets the state machine to the `WAIT_START` state and clears the `data_reg` and `done` signals.'}
