{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].\n\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [99:0] in,\n\toutput [98:0] out_both,\n\toutput [99:1] out_any,\n\toutput [99:0] out_different\n);"}

The code above implements the given Verilog module specification. It uses the `genvar` and `generate` constructs to efficiently generate the necessary logic for each of the three output vectors.

For `out_both`, the code iterates through the input bits from 0 to 98 and assigns the logical AND of the current bit and the next bit to the corresponding output bit.

For `out_any`, the code assigns the value of the last input bit (index 99) to the last output bit (index 99), as it has no neighbor to the right. Then, it iterates through the input bits from 1 to 99 and assigns the logical OR of the current bit and the previous bit to the corresponding output bit.

For `out_different`, the code assigns the XOR of the first input bit (index 0) and the last input bit (index 99) to the first output bit (index 0), as it wraps around. Then, it iterates through the input bits from 1 to 99 and assigns the XOR of the current bit and the previous bit to the corresponding output bit.'}
