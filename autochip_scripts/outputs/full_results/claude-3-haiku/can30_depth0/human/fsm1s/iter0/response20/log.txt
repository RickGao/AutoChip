The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The module has the following features:

1. Two states: A and B, with B being the reset state.
2. One input: `in`.
3. One output: `out`.
4. The reset is active-high synchronous.
5. The state transitions are as follows:
   - From state B, if `in` is 0, the next state is A, and if `in` is 1, the next state remains B.
   - From state A, if `in` is 0, the next state is B, and if `in` is 1, the next state remains A.
6. The output `out` is 1 when the state is B, and 0 when the state is A.

The Verilog code above implements the given state machine specification correctly.'}
