The Verilog code above implements the Moore state machine as described in the problem statement. The key features are:

1. The state variables `state` with parameters `A` and `B` to represent the two states.
2. The `always` block for next state logic, which updates the `state` register based on the current state and the `in` input, with the reset condition.
3. The `always` block for the output logic, which sets the `out` output based on the current state.

The state machine behaves as follows:

- If `reset` is high, the state is set to `B`.
- If the state is `A` and `in` is 0, the next state is `B`.
- If the state is `A` and `in` is 1, the next state remains `A`.
- If the state is `B` and `in` is 0, the next state is `A`.
- If the state is `B` and `in` is 1, the next state remains `B`.
- The output `out` is 0 when the state is `A`, and 1 when the state is `B`.'}
