The completed Verilog module implements the given circuit specification. It consists of:

1. A 2-input XOR gate that takes the input `in` and the output `out` of the D flip-flop, and assigns the result to the signal `xor_out`.
2. A positive edge-triggered D flip-flop that takes the `xor_out` signal as its input and assigns it to the output `out` on every positive edge of the `clk` signal.

No reset signal is provided in the specification, so the D flip-flop does not have a reset functionality.'}
