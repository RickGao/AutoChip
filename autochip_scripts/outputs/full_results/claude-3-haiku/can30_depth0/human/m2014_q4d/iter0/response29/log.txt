```

This Verilog module implements the specified circuit. The module has an input `clk`, an input `in`, and an output `out`.

The circuit consists of two parts:

1. A two-input XOR gate that takes `in` and the output `out` as inputs, and produces the `xor_out` signal.
2. A D flip-flop that is positive edge-triggered by `clk` and takes the `xor_out` signal as its input, updating the `out` output.

The XOR gate is implemented using the `assign` statement, and the D flip-flop is implemented using an `always_ff` block that updates the `out` output on the positive edge of `clk`.'}
