```

This Verilog code implements the desired circuit. It consists of:

1. A two-input XOR gate that takes `in` and the output `out` as inputs, and produces the `xor_out` signal.
2. A positive edge-triggered D flip-flop that takes the `xor_out` signal as the input, and assigns it to the output `out` on every positive edge of the `clk` signal.

The flip-flop does not have a reset signal, as specified in the problem statement.'}
