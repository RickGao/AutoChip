The provided code has a few issues:

1. The `anyedge` output should be registered (using `reg` keyword) to avoid latches.
2. The edge detection is performed by comparing the current input `in` with the input from the previous clock cycle `in_ff1`. This will detect both rising and falling edges.
3. The `anyedge` output is assigned the XOR of the current input `in_ff1` and the previous input `in_ff2`, which will set the corresponding bit in `anyedge` whenever a transition occurs.

The corrected module correctly detects any edge (both rising and falling) and sets the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output.'}
