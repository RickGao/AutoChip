The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. It declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous state of the `in` input.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, it performs the following:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev` to store the previous state.
   - Calculates the XOR of the current `in` value and the previous `in_prev` value, and assigns the result to the `anyedge` output.

This way, the `anyedge` output will be set to 1 for the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs in any of the 8 bits of the `in` input.'}
