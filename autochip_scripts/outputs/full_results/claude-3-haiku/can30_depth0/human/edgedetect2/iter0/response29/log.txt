This Verilog module detects any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) on each bit of the 8-bit input vector `in`. The output `anyedge` is a vector of 8 bits, where each bit is set to 1 in the clock cycle after a transition occurs on the corresponding bit of the input.

The module uses a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`. In each clock cycle, the current value of `in` is compared with the previous value stored in `in_prev` using the XOR operation `in_prev ^ in`. This produces a vector where each bit is set to 1 if there was a transition on the corresponding bit of the input. This vector is then assigned to the output `anyedge`.'}
