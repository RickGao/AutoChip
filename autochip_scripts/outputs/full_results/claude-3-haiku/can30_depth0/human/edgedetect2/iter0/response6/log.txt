This module takes an 8-bit input `in` and a clock signal `clk`. It detects any edge transition (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) on each bit of the input vector and sets the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output vector.

The previous input value is stored in the `in_prev` register. In the always block, the current input value is compared with the previous input value using the XOR operation (`in ^ in_prev`). The resulting 8-bit vector is then assigned to the `anyedge` output register, indicating the bits where an edge transition occurred.'}
