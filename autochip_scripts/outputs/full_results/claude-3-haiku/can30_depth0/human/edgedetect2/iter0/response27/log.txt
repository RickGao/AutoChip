The corrected module has the following changes:

1. The `in_prev` register is used to store the previous input value for comparison.
2. The `anyedge` output is assigned the bitwise XOR of the current input `in` and the previous input `in_prev`. This will set the corresponding bit in `anyedge` whenever there is a transition (either 0-to-1 or 1-to-0) for that bit in the input.
3. The assignment to `anyedge` is done within the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.

This implementation correctly detects any edge (0-to-1 or 1-to-0 transition) for each bit in the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output one clock cycle after the transition occurs.'}
