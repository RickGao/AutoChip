{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. It uses a 512-bit register `q` to store the state of the cells, and updates the state of each cell based on the state of itself and its two neighbors, according to the provided truth table.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `load` input is high, the module loads the state of the cells from the `data` input. Otherwise, it updates the state of the cells based on the Rule 110 logic.

The logic for updating the state of each cell is implemented using a series of bitwise operations, which evaluate the state of the current cell and its neighbors, and set the next state of the current cell accordingly.'}
