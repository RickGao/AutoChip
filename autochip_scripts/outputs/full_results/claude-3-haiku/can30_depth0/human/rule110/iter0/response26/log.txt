{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has a `clk` input to represent the clock, a `load` input to indicate when the system state should be loaded from `data`, and a `q` output to represent the current state of the 512-cell system.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is loaded from the `data` input.
3. If the `load` signal is low, the module computes the next state of the 512-cell system based on the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The next state of each cell is determined by its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors, according to the provided truth table.
4. The boundary conditions (cells with index -1 and 512) are set to 0 (off), as specified in the problem statement.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton.'}
