{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

1. The module `top_module` takes four inputs: `clk`, `load`, `data[511:0]`, and produces one output `q[511:0]`.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
3. If `load` is high, the module simply assigns the input `data[511:0]` to the output `q[511:0]`.
4. If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of the cellular automaton using the Rule 110 logic:
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are handled separately, as their left and right neighbors are assumed to be 0.
   - The remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`) are updated using the Rule 110 logic in a loop.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell system is updated correctly according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton on each clock cycle.'}
