{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0].

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The module has the following behavior:

1. On the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), it checks the value of the `load` input.
2. If `load` is high, the module loads the `data` input into the `q` register, effectively setting the initial state of the 512-cell system.
3. If `load` is low, the module advances the state of the 512-cell system by one time step. It does this by applying the Rule 110 update rule to each cell, based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors.
4. The boundary conditions are set such that the cells at the leftmost and rightmost positions (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) have their neighbors (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) set to 0.

The module uses a `for` loop to update the state of the internal cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), and special case logic to update the leftmost and rightmost cells.'}
