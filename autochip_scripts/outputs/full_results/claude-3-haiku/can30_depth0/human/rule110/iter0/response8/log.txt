{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The key aspects of the completed Verilog module are:

1. The `top_module` takes in the necessary inputs - `clk`, `load`, and `data[511:0]`.
2. The `q[511:0]` output is a 512-bit wide register that stores the current state of the cellular automaton.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module handles two cases:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of the cellular automaton based on the current state and the Rule 110 logic.
       - The first and last cells are handled separately to account for the boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512] are assumed to be 0).
       - For the middle cells, the next state is computed using the Rule 110 logic, where the next state of a cell depends on its left, center, and right neighbors.

This Verilog module implements the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton, updating the state on each clock cycle based on the specified logic.'}
