{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The completed Verilog module for the Rule 110 cellular automaton is as follows:

1. The module has four ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input.
   - `load`: The synchronous active high load input.
   - `data`: A 512-bit input that represents the initial state of the cellular automaton.
   - `q`: A 512-bit output that represents the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the value of the `load` input:
   - If `load` is high, the module loads the `data` input into the `q` output.
   - If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton by following the Rule 110 logic.

4. The update logic for the cellular automaton is implemented using a shift operation. The new state of each cell is calculated by shifting the current state of the cell array one position to the right, and setting the most significant bit to 0. The new value for the least significant bit is calculated by applying the Rule 110 logic to the current values of the most significant bit of `q` (which represents the boundary condition), the least significant bit of `q`, and the second least significant bit of `q`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton as specified in the problem statement.'}
