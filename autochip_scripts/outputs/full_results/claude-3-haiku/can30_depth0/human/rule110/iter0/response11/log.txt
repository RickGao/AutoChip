{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use a `next_q` register to calculate the next state of each cell based on the current state and its two neighbors.
2. Implement the Rule 110 logic using a case statement that checks the combination of the left, center, and right cells.
3. Update the `q` register with the new state on the positive edge of the clock, either loading the provided `data` input or advancing the state based on the `next_q` calculation.
4. Assume the boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

This implementation should correctly implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement.'}
