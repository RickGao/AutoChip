{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided module correctly implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton in Verilog. The main aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has a 512-bit wide `q` register to store the state of the 512-cell system.
2. On the rising edge of the clock, if the `load` input is high, the state is loaded from the `data` input.
3. If the `load` input is low, the state is updated according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton logic:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on `q[1]`, `q[0]`, and `q[511]` (the boundary condition).
   - The intermediate cells `q[1]` to `q[510]` are updated based on `q[i+1]`, `q[i]`, and `q[i-1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is updated based on `q[0]`, `q[511]`, and `q[510]` (the boundary condition).

The logic for updating each cell follows the table provided in the problem statement, ensuring the correct implementation of the Rule 110 cellular automaton.'}
