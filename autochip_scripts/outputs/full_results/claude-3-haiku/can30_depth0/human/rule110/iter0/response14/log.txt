{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton in a 512-cell system. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `load` to indicate when the system state should be loaded from `data[511:0]`, and an output `q[511:0]` that represents the current state of the cells.

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. If `load` is high, the state of the system is simply loaded from the `data` input.

4. If `load` is low, the next state of the cells is computed based on the current state and the Rule 110 update rules:
   - For the first cell `q[0]`, the next state is determined by the current state of `q[0]` and `q[1]`.
   - For the middle cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is determined by the current state of `q[i-1]`, `q[i]`, and `q[i+1]`.
   - For the last cell `q[511]`, the next state is determined by the current state of `q[510]` and `q[511]`.

5. The boundary conditions (cells `q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are assumed to be always off (zero).

This code should correctly implement the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton system.'}
