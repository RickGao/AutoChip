{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton in a 512-cell system. The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `q` register holds the current state of the 512-cell system.
2. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the system from the `data` input.
3. On each clock cycle, the next state of the system is computed based on the Rule 110 cellular automaton update rules.
   - The first and last cells are handled separately, as their neighbors are assumed to be 0 (off).
   - For the remaining cells, the next state is computed based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors.

The Verilog code correctly implements the specified Rule 110 cellular automaton system.'}
