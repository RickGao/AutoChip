{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The key features of this implementation are:

1. A combinational function `next_state` that takes the current state `q` as input and computes the next state based on the Rule 110 transition rules.
2. The `next_state` function handles the boundary conditions by setting `q[-1]` and `q[512]` to 0.
3. The main `always` block updates the state `q` on each clock cycle, either loading the input data `data` or computing the next state using the `next_state` function.

This Verilog module implements the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton as specified in the problem statement.'}
