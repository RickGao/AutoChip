{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided Verilog module implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous active-high enable input, and uses a 3-to-8 decoder and an 8-to-1 multiplexer to select the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the input values A, B, and C.

The key features of the module are:

1. **8-bit Shift Register**: The 8-bit shift register is implemented using a 8-bit register `Q`, which is updated on the positive edge of the clock when `enable` is high. The input `S` is shifted into the MSB of `Q`.

2. **3-to-8 Decoder**: The 3-bit input `A`, `B`, and `C` are used to select one of the 8 output lines of the 3-to-8 decoder. Each output line corresponds to a unique combination of `A`, `B`, and `C`.

3. **8-to-1 Multiplexer**: The 8-to-1 multiplexer is implemented using a `case` statement, which selects the appropriate bit from the shift register `Q` based on the decoder output. The output `Z` is assigned the value of the selected bit.

This module should provide the desired functionality as per the given specification.'}
