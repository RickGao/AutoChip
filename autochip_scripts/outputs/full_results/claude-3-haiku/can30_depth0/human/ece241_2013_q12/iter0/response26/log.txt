{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

This Verilog code implements the 8x1 memory circuit with a shift register and a multiplexer. The shift register has 8 D-type flip-flops, with the input S being shifted in from the most significant bit. The enable signal controls whether the shift register updates on the positive edge of the clock.

The combinational logic for the output Z uses a case statement to select the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the values of inputs A, B, and C. If the input combination is not one of the valid cases (000 to 111), the output Z is set to an unknown value (1'bx).'}
