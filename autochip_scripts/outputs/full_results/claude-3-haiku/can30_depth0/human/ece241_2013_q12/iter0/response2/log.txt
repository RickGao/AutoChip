You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

This module implements an 8-bit shift register using 8 D-type flip-flops, with the shift input `S` feeding the MSB (Q[0]). The `enable` input controls whether the shift register is shifted or not.

The module also implements a 3-to-1 multiplexer to select the output `Z` based on the 3-bit input `{A, B, C}`. When `{A, B, C}` is `000`, `Z` is set to the value of `Q[0]`, and so on for the other combinations.'}
