The key points are:

1. The addition is performed on 9-bit values to accommodate the possible carry-out from the 8-bit addition.
2. The sign bit (`a[7]` and `b[7]`) is extended to 9 bits by replicating it using the `{sign_bit, value}` syntax.
3. The overflow condition is detected by checking if the input signs are the same (`a[7] == b[7]`), but the output sign (`sum[7]`) is different from the input signs, indicating that an overflow has occurred.'}
