The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. The key steps are:

1. Add the two 8-bit numbers `a` and `b` using a 9-bit wide adder (`sum = {1'b0, a} + {1'b0, b}`). This ensures that the sign bit is properly propagated.
2. Assign the 8-bit sum to the output `s`.
3. Detect overflow by checking the sign bits of `a`, `b`, and the sum `s`. Overflow occurs when the signs of `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign of the sum is different.

The module should compile and function correctly.'}
