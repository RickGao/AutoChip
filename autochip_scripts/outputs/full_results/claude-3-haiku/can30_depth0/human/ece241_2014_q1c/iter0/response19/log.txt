The completed Verilog module performs the following steps:

1. Declares a 9-bit wire `temp_sum` to hold the temporary sum of the two 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`.
2. Assigns the 9-bit temporary sum by sign-extending the inputs `a` and `b` to 9 bits and adding them together.
3. Assigns the 8-bit sum `s` by taking the lower 8 bits of the temporary sum.
4. Assigns the `overflow` output by checking if the sign bits of the inputs `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign bit of the temporary sum `temp_sum[7]` is different, indicating an overflow has occurred.

This implementation correctly computes the sum of the two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects the presence of a signed overflow.'}
