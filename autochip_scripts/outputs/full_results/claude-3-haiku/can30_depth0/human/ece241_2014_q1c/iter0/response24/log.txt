The provided Verilog module correctly implements the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects whether an overflow has occurred. The key elements are:

1. The use of a 9-bit wire `sum` to accommodate the possible carry bit from the addition.
2. The assignment of `sum[7:0]` to the output `s[7:0]` to get the 8-bit result.
3. The logic to detect overflow, which checks if the most significant bits of the operands are the same, but the most significant bit of the result is different.

This module should compile and function as expected.'}
