The provided Verilog module correctly performs the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers `a` and `b`, and computes the overflow condition. The module includes the following:

1. A wire declaration `sum` of width 9 bits to hold the result of the addition.
2. An assignment to compute the sum of `a` and `b` and store it in `sum`.
3. An assignment to extract the lower 8 bits of `sum` and store them in the output `s`.
4. An assignment to compute the overflow condition, which is true when the signs of `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign of the result `sum` is different.

This Verilog module should compile and function correctly.'}
