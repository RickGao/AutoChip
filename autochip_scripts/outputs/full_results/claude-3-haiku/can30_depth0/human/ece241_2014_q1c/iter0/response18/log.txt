```

The key points are:

1. Use a 9-bit `sum` wire to store the intermediate result of the addition, to account for the possible overflow.
2. Assign `s` to the lower 8 bits of `sum`.
3. Detect overflow by checking if the signs of the operands are the same, but the sign of the result is different.

The logic for detecting overflow is as follows:
- If the signs of the two operands are the same (`a[7] == b[7]`), and the sign of the result is different from the operands (`a[7] != sum[7]`), then an overflow has occurred.'}
