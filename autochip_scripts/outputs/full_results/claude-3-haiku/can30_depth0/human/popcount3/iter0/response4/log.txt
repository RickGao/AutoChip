The population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector can be implemented using a combination of XOR and AND gates. The output `out[0]` is the XOR of all three input bits, which gives the least significant bit of the population count. The output `out[1]` is the OR of the three AND operations between pairs of input bits, which gives the most significant bit of the population count.'}
