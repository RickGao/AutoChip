The provided Verilog module is correct and should capture when the input signal changes from 1 in one clock cycle to 0 the next, and keep the output at 1 until the register is reset.

The key aspects are:

1. Use a `for` loop to iterate through each bit of the 32-bit input vector.
2. Check if the current bit is 1 and the next bit is 0, indicating a transition from 1 to 0.
3. If the transition is detected, set the corresponding output bit to 1.
4. If the output bit is already 1, keep it at 1 (to maintain the captured state).
5. If the output bit is 0, keep it at 0.
6. Apply the synchronous reset to set all output bits to 0 when the `reset` signal is active.

This implementation should work correctly and meet the given specification.'}
