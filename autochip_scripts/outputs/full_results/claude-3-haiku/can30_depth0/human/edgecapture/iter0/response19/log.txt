The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key steps are:

1. Use a `always @(posedge clk)` block to capture the changes in the input signal `in` on each clock cycle.
2. Check for the condition where the current bit of `in` is 1 and the next bit (using the `~` operator) is 0, indicating a transition from 1 to 0.
3. When this transition is detected, set the corresponding bit in the output `out` to 1 to capture the change.
4. Include a synchronous reset condition to clear the output `out` register when the `reset` signal is active.

This implementation will correctly capture the desired behavior as specified in the module description.'}
