The provided Verilog module specification describes a sequential circuit with a clock input `clk`, an input `a`, and an output `q`. The behavior of the circuit can be determined from the given simulation waveforms:

1. At time 0ns, the circuit starts with unknown values for `a` and `q`.
2. At time 5ns, when `clk` goes high and `a` is 0, the output `q` is set to 1.
3. At time 15ns, 25ns, 35ns, and subsequent odd multiples of 5ns, when `clk` goes high and `a` is 0, the output `q` remains at 1.
4. At time 45ns, when `clk` goes high and `a` is 1, the output `q` is set to 0.
5. At time 55ns, 65ns, 75ns, and subsequent odd multiples of 10ns, when `clk` goes high and `a` is 1, the output `q` remains at 0.

Based on this behavior, the Verilog module implementation is provided, which uses a `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The value of `q` is set to 1 when `a` is 0, and set to 0 when `a` is 1.'}
