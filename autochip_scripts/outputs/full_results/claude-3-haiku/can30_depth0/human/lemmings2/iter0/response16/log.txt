{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal
- `bump_left`: Indicates a collision on the left side
- `bump_right`: Indicates a collision on the right side
- `ground`: Indicates the presence or absence of ground

Outputs:
- `walk_left`: Indicates the Lemming is walking left
- `walk_right`: Indicates the Lemming is walking right
- `aaah`: Indicates the Lemming is falling

The state machine has two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming's walking direction. The state transitions are determined based on the input signals:

1. If the Lemming is walking left (`WALK_LEFT` state) and it hits an obstacle on the right (`bump_right`), it will switch to walking right (`WALK_RIGHT` state).
2. If the Lemming is walking right (`WALK_RIGHT` state) and it hits an obstacle on the left (`bump_left`), it will switch to walking left (`WALK_LEFT` state).
3. When the ground disappears (`ground == 0`), the Lemming will start falling and the `aaah` output will be set to 1.
4. When the ground reappears (`ground == 1`), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.

The module also includes an asynchronous reset functionality (`areset`), which sets the Lemming to walk left (`WALK_LEFT` state) when the reset signal is active.'}
