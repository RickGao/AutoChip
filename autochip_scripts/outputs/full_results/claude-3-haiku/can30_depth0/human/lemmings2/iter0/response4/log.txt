In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle.

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The Lemming can be in one of two states: walking left (WALK_LEFT) or walking right (WALK_RIGHT). The module takes in the following inputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal that sets the Lemming to walk left
- `bump_left`: Signal indicating a bump on the left side
- `bump_right`: Signal indicating a bump on the right side
- `ground`: Signal indicating the presence or absence of ground

The module outputs the following signals:

- `walk_left`: Indicates the Lemming is walking left
- `walk_right`: Indicates the Lemming is walking right
- `aaah`: Indicates the Lemming is falling

The state of the Lemming is stored in the `state` register, which can be either `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT`. The module updates the outputs based on the current state and the input signals, following the behavior described in the problem statement.'}
