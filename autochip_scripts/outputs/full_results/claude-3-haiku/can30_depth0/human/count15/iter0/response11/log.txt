The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has three ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input.
   - `reset`: The active high synchronous reset input.
   - `q`: The 4-bit binary counter output.

2. The counter is implemented using an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

3. Inside the `always` block, the code checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the counter is reset to `4'b0`.

4. If the `reset` input is not high, the counter is incremented by 1. The code checks if the current value of `q` is equal to `4'b1111` (the maximum value of the 4-bit counter). If it is, the counter is reset to `4'b0`, effectively wrapping around to 0.

This Verilog module correctly implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is active high.'}
