The corrected Verilog module includes the following features:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset signal, and an output `q` to represent the 4-bit counter value.
2. The counter is implemented using a `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0.
4. If the `reset` input is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. The counter wraps around to 0 when it reaches the value 15 (4'd15).

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is active high.'}
