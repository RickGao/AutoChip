This Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 15 (4'b1111), it is reset to 0.'}
