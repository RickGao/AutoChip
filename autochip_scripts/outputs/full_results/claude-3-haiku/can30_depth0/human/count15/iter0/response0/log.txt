This Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Inside the block, the counter value `q` is updated based on the following conditions:

1. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is reset to 0 (`4'b0000`).
2. If the counter has reached its maximum value of 15 (`4'b1111`), the counter is reset to 0.
3. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.'}
