The completed Verilog module has the following features:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (synchronous reset input), and `q` (4-bit output representing the counter value).
2. The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` input.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the value of the `reset` input:
   - If `reset` is high, the counter value `q` is set to `4'b0000` (0).
   - If `reset` is low, the module increments the counter value `q` by 1, and if the counter reaches `4'b1111` (15), it wraps around to `4'b0000` (0).

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 through 15 (inclusive) with a period of 16, and the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
