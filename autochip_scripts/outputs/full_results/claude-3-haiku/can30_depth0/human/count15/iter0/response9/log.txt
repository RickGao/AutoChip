The provided Verilog module specification is correct and the completed module is as shown above. The key aspects are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 4-bit width to hold the counter value.
2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the counter value `q` is updated as follows:
   - If `reset` is high, `q` is set to 0.
   - Otherwise, if `q` is equal to 15 (the maximum value), `q` is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 15, inclusive, and resets to 0 when the maximum value is reached or when the `reset` input is high.'}
