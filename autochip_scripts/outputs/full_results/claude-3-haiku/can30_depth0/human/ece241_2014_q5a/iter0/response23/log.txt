This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset, and the conversion begins when `Reset` is released and stops when `Reset` is asserted.

The module has two states: `WAITING` and `CONVERTING`. In the `WAITING` state, the module waits for the reset signal to be released. Once the reset is released, the module transitions to the `CONVERTING` state. In the `CONVERTING` state, the module shifts the input bits into the `temp` register, and once all 8 bits have been shifted in, it calculates the 2's complement of the input and outputs the least-significant bit of the result.

The module uses an 8-bit `count` register to keep track of the number of input bits that have been shifted in, and an 8-bit `temp` register to store the input bits and perform the 2's complement calculation.'}
