This Verilog module implements a serial 2's complementer using a Moore state machine. The key features are:

1. `count` register to keep track of the bit position being processed.
2. `complement` register to store the input bits in reverse order.
3. The `z` output is set to the 2's complement of the current bit in the `complement` register, with the last bit being 1 to complete the 2's complement.
4. The module uses an asynchronous reset `areset` to initialize the registers when the reset is asserted.
5. The module starts the conversion when the reset is released and stops when the reset is asserted.'}
