This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits, one per clock cycle, representing the number to be converted. The output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.

The module has two states:
1. **Conversion mode**: In this state, the module accepts the input bits and stores them in the `complement` register. When all 8 bits have been received, the state transitions to the Complement mode.
2. **Complement mode**: In this state, the module performs the 2's complement operation on the stored number by negating the bits and adding 1. The result is then output on the `z` pin.

The module also has an asynchronous reset input `areset` that clears the state, counter, and complement registers when asserted.'}
