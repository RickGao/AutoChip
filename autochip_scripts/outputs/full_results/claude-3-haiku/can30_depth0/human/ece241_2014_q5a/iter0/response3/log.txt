The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. Defined a state machine with two states: S_INIT and S_CONVERT.
2. Used a register `result` to hold the intermediate 2's complement calculation.
3. In the `S_INIT` state, reset the `result` and `z` outputs.
4. In the `S_CONVERT` state, shift the `result` left by one bit and append the current input `x`, then compute the 2's complement output `z` based on the most significant bit of `result`.
5. Implemented the state transition logic in the always block that updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the `areset` signal.
6. Synthesized the complete Moore state machine in the top-level module `top_module`.'}
