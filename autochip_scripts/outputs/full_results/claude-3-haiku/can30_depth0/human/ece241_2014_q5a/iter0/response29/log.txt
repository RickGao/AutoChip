The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Defined the state parameters for the state machine: `IDLE`, `COMPUTE`, and `DONE`.
2. Initialized the state, `num`, and `complement` registers in the `areset` block.
3. Implemented the state machine logic in the `case` statement:
   - In the `IDLE` state, the machine waits for `areset` to be released to start the computation.
   - In the `COMPUTE` state, the input bit `x` is shifted into the `num` register, and the complement is computed by shifting the inverse of `x` into the `complement` register. When `areset` is asserted, the state transitions to `DONE`.
   - In the `DONE` state, the final 2's complement is computed by adding 1 to the `complement` register, and the least-significant bit is output as `z`. When `areset` is released, the state transitions back to `COMPUTE`, and the registers are reset.
4. Included a default case to handle any unexpected state transitions.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine.'}
