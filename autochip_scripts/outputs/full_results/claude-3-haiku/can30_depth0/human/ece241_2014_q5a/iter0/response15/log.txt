The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.

The key points in the corrected code are:

1. Declared a `reg z` output to hold the 2's complement output.
2. Declared `reg [7:0] counter` to keep track of the number of bits processed.
3. Declared `reg [7:0] result` to store the intermediate results.
4. Declared `reg state` to track the state of the state machine.
5. Defined the state parameters `IDLE` and `CONVERT`.
6. In the `IDLE` state, transitioned to `CONVERT` state when reset is released.
7. In the `CONVERT` state, shifted the new input bit into the `result` register and incremented the `counter`.
8. When the `counter` reached 8, output the 2's complement of the final result.
9. Returned to the `IDLE` state after the conversion is complete.'}
