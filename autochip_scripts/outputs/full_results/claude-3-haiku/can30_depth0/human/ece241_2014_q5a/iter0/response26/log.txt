This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits, one per clock cycle, representing the least-significant bit of the input number. The output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The circuit has a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset `areset`, and the conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.

The module has two states: `IDLE` and `COMPUTE`. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for `areset` to be released, and then transitions to the `COMPUTE` state. In the `COMPUTE` state, the module shifts the input `x` into the `complement` register, and updates the `count` of the number of bits received. When all 8 bits have been received (i.e., `count == 7` and `x == 0`), the module computes the 2's complement of the `complement` register and assigns the least-significant bit to the output `z`. The module then transitions back to the `IDLE` state.'}
