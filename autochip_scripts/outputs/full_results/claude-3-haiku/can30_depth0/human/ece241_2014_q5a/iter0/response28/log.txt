The provided Verilog module implements a serial 2's complementer Moore state machine as per the given specification. It has the following features:

1. The module has four signals: `clk` (clock), `areset` (asynchronous reset), `x` (input bit), and `z` (output 2's complement bit).
2. The module has three states: `IDLE`, `COMPUTE`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the module initializes the necessary variables (`input_num`, `complement`, `z`) and waits for the `areset` to be released.
4. In the `COMPUTE` state, the module shifts the input bit `x` into the `input_num` register and increments the `complement` register.
5. When the most significant bit of `input_num` is set (indicating the end of the input), the module transitions to the `DONE` state, where it outputs the most significant bit of the `complement` register as the 2's complement of the input.
6. The module then returns to the `IDLE` state, waiting for the next input.
7. The module uses asynchronous reset, where the state machine is reset to the `IDLE` state when `areset` is high.

The provided Verilog module should correctly implement the given serial 2's complementer Moore state machine specification.'}
