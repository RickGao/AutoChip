The provided Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine accepts input numbers of arbitrary length and the conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.

The module has three states:
1. `IDLE`: the initial state where the machine waits for the `areset` to be released.
2. `COMPUTE`: the state where the input bits are shifted into the `temp_sum` register and the `bit_count` is incremented. When the 8th bit is received, the state transitions to `COMPLETE`.
3. `COMPLETE`: the state where the 2's complement of the `temp_sum` is calculated and assigned to the output `z`. The state remains in `COMPLETE` until `areset` is asserted, then it transitions back to `IDLE`.

The module uses an asynchronous reset `areset` to reset the state machine, the `temp_sum` register, the `bit_count`, and the output `z`.'}
