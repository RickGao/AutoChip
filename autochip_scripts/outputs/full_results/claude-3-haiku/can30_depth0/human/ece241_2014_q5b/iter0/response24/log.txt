The provided Verilog code implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. It has an asynchronous active-high reset (`areset`) that resets the state to `STATE_A`.
2. The state transition logic is defined in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `x`.
3. The output `z` is also updated in the `always @(*)` block based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block updates the current state to the `next_state` on the positive edge of the clock or when the `areset` signal is high.

The Mealy machine implementation follows the state diagram provided in the problem statement.'}
