The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy machine for a 2's complementer using one-hot encoding. The module has four main parts:

1. State register: The state is stored in a 2-bit register `state`, which can take values `A` or `B`.
2. Next state logic: The next state is determined based on the current state and the input `x` using a `case` statement in the `always` block.
3. Output logic: The output `z` is assigned based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. Asynchronous reset: The state is reset to `A` when the `areset` signal is high.

The Mealy machine behaves as follows:
- If the state is `A` and `x` is 0, the next state is `A` and `z` is 0.
- If the state is `A` and `x` is 1, the next state is `B` and `z` is 1.
- If the state is `B` and `x` is 0, the next state is `B` and `z` is 1.
- If the state is `B` and `x` is 1, the next state is `B` and `z` is 0.'}
