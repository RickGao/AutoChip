This Verilog module implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. It has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. It uses two state variables `state` and `next_state` to represent the current and next state of the Mealy machine, respectively.
3. The state assignment uses one-hot encoding, with `A` represented as `2'b01` and `B` represented as `2'b10`.
4. The module resets asynchronously to state `A` when `areset` is high.
5. The `always` block for the state transition updates the `state` register on the positive edge of `clk`.
6. The `always` block for the output logic determines the output `z` based on the current `state` and the input `x`.
7. The default case in the output logic block ensures that the output is set to 0 for any undefined state.

The module correctly implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine as specified in the diagram.'}
