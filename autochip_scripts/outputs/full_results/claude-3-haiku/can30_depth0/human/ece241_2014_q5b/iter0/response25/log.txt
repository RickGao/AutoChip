The provided Verilog code implements the Mealy machine 2's complementer using one-hot encoding. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The state encoding uses two bits to represent the states A and B.
3. The `state` and `next_state` registers hold the current and next states, respectively.
4. The `state_update_logic` always block updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset is active high.
5. The `next_state_and_output_logic` always block determines the next state and the output `z` based on the current state and the input `x`.
   - In state A, if `x` is 0, the next state is A, and `z` is 0. If `x` is 1, the next state is B, and `z` is 1.
   - In state B, if `x` is 0, the next state is B, and `z` is 1. If `x` is 1, the next state is B, and `z` is 0.
   - If the state is not A or B, the next state is set to A, and `z` is 0.

This Verilog code correctly implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding and the specified state transition and output logic.'}
