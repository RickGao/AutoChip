The above Verilog code implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` signal to 1, which remains high until the module is reset.

The FSM has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the first '1' in the input sequence.
2. `SEARCH_1`: Looks for the next '0' after the first '1'.
3. `SEARCH_10`: Looks for the next '1' after the '0'.
4. `SEARCH_101`: Looks for the final '1' to complete the sequence 1101.

The `next_state` logic transitions the FSM between these states based on the current state and the input data. When the final '1' is detected in the `SEARCH_101` state, the `start_shifting` signal is set to 1.

The reset signal is handled synchronously, and upon reset, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state and the `start_shifting` signal is cleared.'}
