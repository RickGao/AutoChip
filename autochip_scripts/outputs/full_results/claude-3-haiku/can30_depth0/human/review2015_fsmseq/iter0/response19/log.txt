The provided Verilog module is correct and implements the required functionality. It is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream and sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 when the sequence is found, until the `reset` input is activated.

The module has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the first 1 in the sequence.
2. `FOUND_1`: The first 1 in the sequence has been found.
3. `FOUND_11`: The first two 1s in the sequence have been found.
4. `FOUND_110`: The sequence 1101 has been found.

The `next_state` logic transitions the state machine based on the current state and the input `data`. When the sequence 1101 is found, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high until the `reset` input is activated.'}
