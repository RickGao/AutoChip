This Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in the input data stream. When the sequence is found, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module has four states:
- `IDLE`: Waits for the first '1' in the sequence.
- `SEARCH_1`: Looks for the next '1' in the sequence.
- `SEARCH_11`: Looks for the '0' after the two '1's.
- `SEARCH_101`: Looks for the final '1' in the sequence.

If the complete sequence "1101" is detected, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high until the `reset` input is asserted.'}
