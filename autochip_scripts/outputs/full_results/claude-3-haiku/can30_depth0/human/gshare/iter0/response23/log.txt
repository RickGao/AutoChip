{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4. Reset is asynchronous active-high.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset, \n\n\tinput predict_valid,\n\tinput [6:0] predict_pc,\n\toutput predict_taken, \n\toutput [6:0] predict_history,\n\n\tinput train_valid,\n\tinput train_taken,\n\tinput train_mispredicted,\n\tinput [6:0] train_history, \n\tinput [6:0] train_pc\n);"}

This Verilog code implements a gshare branch predictor with a 7-bit PC and 7-bit global history, hashed into a 7-bit index to access a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: one for making predictions and one for training the predictor.

The `predict_valid` signal indicates when a prediction is requested, and the `predict_pc` input provides the PC of the branch to be predicted. The `predict_taken` output indicates the predicted branch direction, and the `predict_history` output provides the global branch history register state used to make the prediction.

The `train_valid` signal indicates when training is requested, and the `train_taken`, `train_mispredicted`, `train_history`, and `train_pc` inputs provide the actual branch outcome, whether the branch was mispredicted, the global history register state at the time of the branch, and the PC of the branch being trained, respectively.

The module updates the global history register and the pattern history table (PHT) based on the training information. If a misprediction occurs, the global history register is recovered to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution. If both a prediction and training for the same PHT entry happen in the same cycle, the training takes precedence, as the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway.

The reset signal `areset` is asynchronous and active-high.'}
