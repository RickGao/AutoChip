Explanation:
- The state assignment is one-hot encoding, where each state is represented by a single bit in the 6-bit `y` register.
- The logic for `Y1` is derived by inspecting the state transitions:
  - From state A (y[0]), the next state is A (y[0]) when `w` is 0, and B (y[1]) when `w` is 1.
  - From state B (y[1]), the next state is D (y[3]) when `w` is 0, and C (y[2]) when `w` is 1.
  - From state E (y[4]), the next state is E (y[4]) when `w` is 1, and D (y[3]) when `w` is 0.
  - From state F (y[5]), the next state is C (y[2]) when `w` is 1, and D (y[3]) when `w` is 0.
- The logic for `Y3` is derived by inspecting the state transitions:
  - From state B (y[1]), the next state is D (y[3]) when `w` is 0, and C (y[2]) when `w` is 1.
  - From state C (y[2]), the next state is D (y[3]) when `w` is 0.
  - From state D (y[3]), the next state is A (y[0]) when `w` is 0, and F (y[5]) when `w` is 1.
  - From state F (y[5]), the next state is D (y[3]) when `w` is 0.'}
