The issues with the original code were:

1. The `case` statement was not handling the `do_sub` input correctly. It was performing the addition or subtraction based on the value of `do_sub` rather than using it to select the operation.
2. The condition for setting `result_is_zero` was incorrect. It was checking if the entire `out` value was zero, which is not the correct way to determine if the result is zero. The correct way is to directly compare the `out` value with zero.

In the corrected code:

1. The `always` block uses an `if-else` statement to perform the addition or subtraction based on the value of `do_sub`.
2. The `result_is_zero` output is set based on a direct comparison of the `out` value with zero, using the ternary operator.

This ensures that the adder-subtractor module works correctly and sets the `result_is_zero` flag appropriately.'}
