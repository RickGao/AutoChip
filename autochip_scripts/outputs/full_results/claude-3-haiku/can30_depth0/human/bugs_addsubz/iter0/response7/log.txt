```

The original code had two issues:

1. The case statement was not handling the subtraction correctly. It should be `out = a - b` for `do_sub == 1`.
2. The check for `result_is_zero` was incorrect. It was checking if the entire `out` register was zero, instead of checking if the result of the operation was zero. The correct way to do this is to assign `result_is_zero` directly based on the value of `out`.

The corrected code addresses these issues and should now work as expected.'}
