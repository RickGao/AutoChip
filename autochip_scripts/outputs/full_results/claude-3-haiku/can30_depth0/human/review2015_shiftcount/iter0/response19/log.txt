This Verilog module implements a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The behavior is as follows:

1. If `shift_ena` is 1, the data input is shifted into the most significant bit of the register `q`, and the existing bits are shifted to the right.
2. If `count_ena` is 1, the value in the register `q` is decremented by 1.
3. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 0, the value in the register `q` remains unchanged.

The module uses a single `always` block that checks the values of `shift_ena` and `count_ena` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` and performs the appropriate operation on the register `q`.'}
