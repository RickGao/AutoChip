This Verilog module implements a 4-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Here's how it works:

1. On the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`:
   - If `shift_ena` is 1, the existing 4-bit value in `q` is shifted left by one bit, and the new most-significant bit is set to the value of `data`.
   - If `count_ena` is 1, the existing 4-bit value in `q` is decremented by 1.
   - If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 0, the value in `q` remains unchanged.

The module uses a single `always` block to handle both the shift operation and the decrement operation, and the behavior is defined based on the values of the control signals `shift_ena` and `count_ena`.'}
