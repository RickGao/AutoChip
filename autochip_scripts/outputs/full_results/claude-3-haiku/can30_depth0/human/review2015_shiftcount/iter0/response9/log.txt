{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has four inputs: `clk`, `shift_ena`, `count_ena`, and `data`.
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 4-bit register.
3. The module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
4. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the value of `shift_ena`:
   - If `shift_ena` is 1, the module shifts the `data` input into the most significant bit of `q`, and shifts the other bits of `q` one position to the right.
5. If `shift_ena` is 0, the module checks the value of `count_ena`:
   - If `count_ena` is 1, the module decrements the value of `q` by 1.
6. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 0, the module does not perform any operation on `q`.

This Verilog module implements the required four-bit shift register with a down counter functionality.'}
