{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

This Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `get_neighbors` function calculates the number of neighboring cells that are alive for a given cell. The main `always` block updates the game state every clock cycle based on the rules of the Game of Life.

The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the game from the `data` input. The `q` output represents the current state of the game, which is updated every clock cycle.'}
