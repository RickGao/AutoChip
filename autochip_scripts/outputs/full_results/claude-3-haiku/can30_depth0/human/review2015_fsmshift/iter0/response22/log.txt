The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. The module has three states:

1. `STATE_IDLE`: When the module is in this state, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 0 and the `cycle_count` is reset to 0.
2. `STATE_SHIFT`: When the module is in this state, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 1 and the `cycle_count` is incremented. When the `cycle_count` reaches 3 (4 clock cycles), the next state is set to `STATE_HOLD`.
3. `STATE_HOLD`: When the module is in this state, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 0.

The module also handles the reset signal correctly. When the `reset` signal is asserted, the module transitions to the `STATE_SHIFT` state and sets `shift_ena` to 1 for 4 clock cycles, then transitions to the `STATE_IDLE` state, where `shift_ena` remains 0 until the next reset.'}
