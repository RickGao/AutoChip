The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output signal to make it a registered output.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is asserted to 1 and the state transitions to `SHIFT`.
4. In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` signal remains asserted to 1 until the state transitions to `DONE`.
5. In the `DONE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is deasserted to 0.
6. The state machine transitions back to the `IDLE` state in the default case, ensuring that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
