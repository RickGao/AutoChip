The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. Declared the `shift_ena` output as a `reg` type.
2. Defined a `localparam` named `CYCLES` to represent the desired number of clock cycles to enable the shift register.
3. Implemented a state machine with 4 states to control the `shift_ena` signal:
   - In the initial state (0), `shift_ena` is asserted and the next state is 1.
   - In the next 3 states (1, 2, and 3), `shift_ena` is also asserted, and the state machine transitions to the next state.
   - In the final state (3), the state machine stays in the same state, and `shift_ena` is deasserted.
4. Upon a reset, the state machine is reset to the initial state (0), and `shift_ena` is asserted for the first 4 clock cycles.

This implementation ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then deasserted forever (until the next reset).'}
