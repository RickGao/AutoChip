The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared `shift_ena` as a `reg` type output, as it needs to be assigned a value inside the module.
2. Included a `count` register to keep track of the number of cycles the `shift_ena` signal should be asserted.
3. Added a synchronous reset logic that sets `shift_ena` to 1 and `count` to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.
4. In the main logic, the `count` is incremented until it reaches `CYCLES - 1`, at which point `shift_ena` is set to 0 and `count` is reset to 0.
5. The `shift_ena` signal is asserted for the first `CYCLES` cycles after the reset signal is asserted, and then remains 0 until the next reset.'}
