The corrected module operates as follows:

1. When `reset` is asserted, the module enters the `IDLE` state, sets `count` to 0, and asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles.
2. After the initial 4 clock cycles, the module transitions to the `SHIFT` state and de-asserts `shift_ena`.
3. In the `SHIFT` state, the module increments `count` on each clock cycle. When `count` reaches 3, the module transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
4. The module will remain in the `IDLE` state until the next `reset` is asserted, at which point the cycle repeats.

The key changes from the original specification are:
1. Added a state register and next state logic to manage the state transitions.
2. Implemented the `shift_ena` logic to assert it for 4 clock cycles when the module is in the `SHIFT` state and `count` is less than 3.
3. Handled the reset condition to assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles and then de-assert it until the next reset.'}
