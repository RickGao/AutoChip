The provided module is a Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal for a shift register. The module has the following behavior:

1. When the `reset` signal is asserted (high), the module enters the `WAIT_STATE` and sets `shift_ena` to 0.
2. After reset, the module transitions to the `ENABLE_STATE`, and asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles.
3. After 4 clock cycles in the `ENABLE_STATE`, the module transitions to the `DISABLE_STATE`, where `shift_ena` is set to 0 until the next reset.
4. The module remains in the `DISABLE_STATE` until the next reset, at which point it will transition back to the `ENABLE_STATE` and the cycle repeats.

The module uses a combinational logic block to determine the next state based on the current state and the value of `shift_ena`. This ensures that the module behaves correctly and meets the specified requirements.'}
