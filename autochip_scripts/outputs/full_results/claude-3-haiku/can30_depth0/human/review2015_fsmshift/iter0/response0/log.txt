The module has been corrected to include the following changes:

1. The `shift_ena` signal is declared as a `reg` output to allow it to be assigned a value within the module.
2. The `SHIFT_CYCLES` parameter is set to 4, as specified in the module description.
3. The state machine has two states: `IDLE` and `SHIFT`.
4. When the module is reset, the state is set to `SHIFT`, and `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles.
5. After 4 clock cycles, the state transitions to `IDLE`, and `shift_ena` is deasserted and remains so until the next reset.
6. The default case in the state machine ensures that if the state is not `SHIFT` or `IDLE`, the module defaults to `IDLE` with `shift_ena` deasserted.

This module should now correctly implement the desired behavior as specified in the module description.'}
