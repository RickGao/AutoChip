The module has been corrected as follows:

1. Added a state register `state` to keep track of the current state of the FSM.
2. Defined the states as `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `always` block:
   - Handled the reset condition by resetting the state to `IDLE` and asserting `shift_ena` to 1.
   - In the `IDLE` state, set `shift_ena` to 1 and transitioned to the `SHIFT` state.
   - In the `SHIFT` state, kept `shift_ena` high and transitioned to the `DONE` state after 4 cycles.
   - In the `DONE` state, set `shift_ena` to 0 and waited for the next reset to return to the `IDLE` state.
   - Added a default case to handle any undefined states.

The module now correctly asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keeps it deasserted until the next reset.'}
