The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has two inputs, `clk` and `reset`, and one output, `shift_ena`.
2. The module uses a 2-bit counter `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles since the reset.
3. When `reset` is asserted, the counter is reset to 0 and `shift_ena` is set to 1.
4. On each subsequent clock cycle, the counter is incremented, and `shift_ena` is set to 1 until the counter reaches 3 (binary 11), at which point `shift_ena` is set to 0.
5. This ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles after the reset, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
