The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared `shift_ena` as a `reg` output to allow it to be assigned a value within the module.
2. Added a 2-bit counter `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted.
3. In the `always` block:
   - On reset, initialized `count` to 0 and asserted `shift_ena` to 1.
   - If `count` is less than 3 (2'b11), incremented `count` and kept `shift_ena` asserted.
   - If `count` reaches 3, reset `count` to 0 and deasserted `shift_ena`.

This implementation ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
