The provided Verilog code is a module that controls the enable signal for a shift register. The module has the following functionality:

1. When the `reset` signal is high, the module enters the `IDLE` state and asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles.
2. After 4 clock cycles in the `IDLE` state, the module transitions to the `DONE` state and de-asserts the `shift_ena` signal.
3. The `shift_ena` signal remains de-asserted until the next `reset` signal.
4. If the `reset` signal is de-asserted, the module remains in the `DONE` state and continues to de-assert the `shift_ena` signal.

The module uses a `state` register to keep track of the current state of the FSM, and a `RESET_CYCLES` counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles the `shift_ena` signal has been asserted during the `IDLE` state.'}
