The module is designed to control the shift register by enabling it for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected. When the reset signal is asserted, the module enters the `ENABLE` state and sets the `shift_ena` output to `1'b1` for 4 clock cycles, then transitions to the `HOLD` state where `shift_ena` is set to `1'b0` permanently (until the next reset).

The module uses a 2-bit state register to keep track of the current state. The state transitions are as follows:

1. `IDLE`: The module is in the idle state, and `shift_ena` is set to `1'b0`.
2. `ENABLE`: The module is in the enable state, and `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1`. After 4 clock cycles, the module transitions to the `HOLD` state.
3. `HOLD`: The module is in the hold state, and `shift_ena` is set to `1'b0`.

The module uses a `RESET_CYCLES` parameter to determine the number of cycles that `shift_ena` should be asserted when the reset signal is active.'}
