The provided module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module implementation is provided above. The module includes the following features:

1. The module has three states: IDLE, SHIFT, and RESET.
2. When the `reset` input is asserted, the module enters the RESET state and asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles, then transitions to the IDLE state.
3. In the IDLE state, the module waits for the `reset` input to be asserted, at which point it transitions to the RESET state.
4. The `shift_ena` output is asserted for 4 clock cycles when the module is in the RESET state, and is deasserted in all other states.
5. The module uses a counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the RESET state, and transitions back to the IDLE state when the counter reaches 3.'}
