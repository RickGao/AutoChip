The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared a `shift_ena` output as a register to enable the assignment of a value to it.
2. Defined the `SHIFT_CYCLES` parameter to specify the number of cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. Declared the `state` register to keep track of the current state of the FSM.
4. Included the reset logic to set the state to `STATE_SHIFT` and assert `shift_ena` when the reset signal is active.
5. Implemented the state machine logic to control the `shift_ena` signal based on the current state and the number of shift cycles.
6. Ensured that the `shift_ena` signal is deasserted in the `STATE_IDLE` state.
7. Added a default case to handle any unexpected states.

The corrected module should now correctly enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and assert `shift_ena` for 4 cycles when the FSM is reset, then keep it deasserted forever until the next reset.'}
