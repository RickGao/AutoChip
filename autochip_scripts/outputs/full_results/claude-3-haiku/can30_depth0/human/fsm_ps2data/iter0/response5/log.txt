{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [23:0] out_bytes,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The module implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. The key points are:

1. The module has three internal state registers: `state`, `message_bytes`, and `message_start`.
2. The `state` register keeps track of the current state of the FSM, which can be one of the four states: 00, 01, 10, and 11.
3. The `message_bytes` register stores the 24-bit message that is being constructed.
4. The `message_start` flag indicates whether the first byte of a new message has been received.
5. In the initial state (00), the module waits for the first byte with `in[3] == 1`, indicating the start of a new message.
6. Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to state 01 and starts storing the message bytes in `message_bytes`.
7. The module transitions through states 01 and 10 to collect all three bytes of the message.
8. When the third byte is received, the module transitions to state 11, where it sets the `done` signal and resets the `message_start` flag.
9. The `out_bytes` output is driven by the `message_bytes` register, and the `done` output is generated based on the state transition to state 11 and the `message_start` flag.

The provided waveform example shows the expected behavior of the module, and the implementation matches this specification.'}
