The provided Verilog module specification describes a digital system with four inputs (a, b, c, d) and two outputs (out_sop and out_pos). The system generates a logic-1 output when the input combination corresponds to 2, 7, or 15, and a logic-0 output when the input combination corresponds to 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14.

The Verilog module provided in the response implements the specified functionality in two parts:

1. `out_sop` is assigned the minimum sum-of-products form, which is the logical OR of the three minterms corresponding to the input combinations that generate a logic-1 output: `(~a & ~b & ~c & d)`, `(a & ~b & c & d)`, and `(a & b & c & d)`.

2. `out_pos` is assigned the minimum product-of-sums form, which is the logical AND of the three maxterms corresponding to the input combinations that generate a logic-0 output: `(~a | ~b | ~c | d)`, `(a | ~b | c | d)`, and `(a | b | c | d)`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified digital system and provides the outputs in both the minimum sum-of-products and minimum product-of-sums forms.'}
