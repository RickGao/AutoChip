The given specification describes a digital system with four inputs (a, b, c, d) that generates a logic-1 output when the input combination corresponds to the decimal numbers 2, 7, or 15, and a logic-0 output for the input combinations corresponding to the decimal numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14.

The corrected Verilog module is provided above, which implements the required functionality in both the Sum-of-Products (SOP) form and the Product-of-Sums (POS) form.

For the SOP form, the output `out_sop` is assigned the logical expression that covers the input combinations for the decimal numbers 2, 7, and 15.

For the POS form, three intermediate terms (`term1`, `term2`, and `term3`) are defined, and the output `out_pos` is assigned the logical expression that covers the input combinations for the decimal numbers 3, 11, and 12 (the only input combinations that are never supposed to occur in this system).'}
