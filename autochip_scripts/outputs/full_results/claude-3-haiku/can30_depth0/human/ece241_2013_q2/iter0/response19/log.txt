The output `out_sop` is expressed in minimum sum-of-products form, where the logic-1 conditions (2, 7, and 15) are represented as individual product terms, and the logic-0 conditions (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14) are represented as additional product terms.

The output `out_pos` is expressed in minimum product-of-sums form, where the logic-0 conditions are represented as individual sum terms, and the logic-1 conditions are represented as additional sum terms.'}
