This Verilog module implements a full adder. The key steps are:

1. Calculate the XOR of `a` and `b` to get the sum without the carry.
2. Calculate the AND of `a` and `b` to get the carry from the addition of `a` and `b`.
3. Calculate the AND of `cin` and the XOR of `a` and `b` to get the carry from the addition of `cin` and the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. Assign the XOR of `a_xor_b` and `cin` to `sum` to get the final sum.
5. Assign the OR of `a_and_b` and `cin_and_a_xor_b` to `cout` to get the final carry-out.'}
