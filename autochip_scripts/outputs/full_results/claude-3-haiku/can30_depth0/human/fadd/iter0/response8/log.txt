This Verilog module implements a full adder by first creating a half adder for the `a` and `b` inputs, and then combining it with the `cin` input to produce the final `sum` and `cout` outputs.

The half adder is implemented using the XOR and AND operators to compute the intermediate signals `w1` and `w2`. Then, the full adder logic is implemented by using another XOR to compute the `sum` output, and an OR to compute the `cout` output based on the intermediate signals `w2` and `w3`.'}
