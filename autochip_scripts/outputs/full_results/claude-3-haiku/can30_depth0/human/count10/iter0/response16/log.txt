The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (active-high synchronous reset input), and `q` (4-bit output).
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the code checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the counter value `q` is reset to 0.
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the code checks if the current value of `q` is 9. If it is, the counter is reset to 0.
5. If the current value of `q` is not 9, the counter is incremented by 1.

This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets the counter to 0 on a synchronous active-high reset signal.'}
