This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 4'b0000 (0). Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1 using the `+` operator. When the counter reaches the value 4'b1001 (9), the next value is set to 4'b0000 (0) using the ternary operator `?:`.'}
