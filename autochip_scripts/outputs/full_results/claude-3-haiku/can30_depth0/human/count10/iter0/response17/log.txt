The given Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is provided above. The module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous, and it resets the counter to 0.

The module uses an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside the block, it checks if the reset input is high, and if so, it sets the output `q` to 0. If the reset input is not high, it checks if the current value of `q` is 9 (the maximum value for a 4-bit counter). If it is, it resets `q` to 0. Otherwise, it increments `q` by 1.'}
