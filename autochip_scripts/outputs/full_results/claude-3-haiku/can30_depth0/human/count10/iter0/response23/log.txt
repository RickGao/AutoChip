The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the above code implements the desired decade counter functionality. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` to represent the 4-bit counter value.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the counter value `q` is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
4. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle, and when the value reaches 9, it is reset back to 0.

This implementation will correctly count from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and reset the counter to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
