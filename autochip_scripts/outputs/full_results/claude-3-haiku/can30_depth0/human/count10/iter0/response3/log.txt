The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module is named `top_module` and has two inputs, `clk` (clock) and `reset`, and one output `q` of 4-bit width.
2. The counter is implemented using an always block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the always block, the following logic is implemented:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter `q` is reset to `4'd0` (4-bit binary value 0).
   - If the counter `q` is equal to `4'd9` (4-bit binary value 9), it is reset to `4'd0`.
   - Otherwise, the counter `q` is incremented by 1.

This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, and resets to 0 upon a high `reset` signal.'}
