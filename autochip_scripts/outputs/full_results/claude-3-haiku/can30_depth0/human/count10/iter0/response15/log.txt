The corrected Verilog module has the following features:

1. The `q` output is declared as a 4-bit register to represent the decade counter.
2. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is reset to `4'b0000`.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. If the counter reaches `4'b1001` (representing 9), it is reset to `4'b0000`.

This implementation ensures that the decade counter counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and the reset input resets the counter to 0 synchronously.'}
