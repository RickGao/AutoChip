{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The corrected Verilog module above implements the specified synchronous HDLC framing logic using a Moore-type finite state machine. The module takes the input bit stream `in` and generates the following output signals:

1. `disc`: Asserted for one clock cycle when a bit needs to be discarded (pattern 0111110).
2. `flag`: Asserted for one clock cycle when a frame boundary is detected (pattern 01111110).
3. `err`: Asserted for one clock cycle when an error is detected (7 or more consecutive 1s).

The module handles the reset signal correctly, and the state machine transitions between the four defined states (`IDLE`, `WAIT1`, `WAIT5`, `ERROR`) based on the input bit `in`. The output logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block to generate the appropriate output signals based on the current state.'}
