{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets).

To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three specified sequences: 

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output asserted)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output asserted)
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (`err` output asserted)

The module has a reset signal that synchronously sets the state machine to the IDLE state, where the output signals are deasserted. The state machine tracks the count of consecutive 1s and transitions between the four states (IDLE, DISCARD, FLAG, ERROR) based on the current input and state.

The output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted for a complete clock cycle beginning on the cycle after the corresponding condition is detected.'}
