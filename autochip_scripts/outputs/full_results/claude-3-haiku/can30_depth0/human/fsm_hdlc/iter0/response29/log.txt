{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences described in the problem statement: 

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output is asserted)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output is asserted)
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more consecutive 1s) (`err` output is asserted)

The module has four states: `IDLE`, `DISC`, `FLAG`, and `ERR`. The `next_state` logic transitions between these states based on the current input `in`. The output signals `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are asserted when the corresponding condition is detected.

The module also includes a synchronous reset signal `reset` that sets the state to `IDLE` when asserted.'}
