To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements the synchronous HDLC framing state machine as per the provided specification. The module has three output signals: `disc`, `flag`, and `err`, which indicate the three different conditions described in the problem statement.

The module uses a three-bit state machine to track the different states of the framing process. The `IDLE` state is the initial state, and the state machine transitions to the appropriate state based on the current input `in` and the current count of consecutive 1s (`count`).

The `disc` signal is asserted when the state machine detects the "0111110" sequence, indicating that a bit needs to be discarded. The `flag` signal is asserted when the state machine detects the "01111110" sequence, indicating the beginning or end of a frame. The `err` signal is asserted when the state machine detects 7 or more consecutive 1s, indicating an error.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the state machine is reset to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` signal is asserted.'}
