{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The finite state machine has the following states:
- `STATE_INIT`: Initial state, assumes previous input was 0.
- `STATE_ONE` to `STATE_FIV`: Consecutive 1 states, used to detect 0b01111110 (flag) and 0b0111110 (disc).
- `STATE_SIX`: Detected 0b0111110, assert `disc` output.
- `STATE_FLAG`: Detected 0b01111110, assert `flag` output.
- `STATE_ERR`: Detected 7 or more consecutive 1s, assert `err` output.

The state transitions and output generation logic are implemented in the always block that handles the next state and output assignments.'}
