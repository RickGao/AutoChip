{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences specified in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output)
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (`err` output)

The module has three main states:

- `IDLE`: The initial state, where the module waits for the input to become 1.
- `DISC`: The state where the module detects the `0111110` sequence and asserts the `disc` output.
- `FLAG`: The state where the module detects the `01111110` sequence and asserts the `flag` output.
- `ERR`: The state where the module detects the `01111111` sequence and asserts the `err` output.

The module uses a registered state variable `state` and a combinational next state logic `next_state` to transition between the states based on the input `in`. The output signals `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are set accordingly in the combinational logic.

The module also includes a synchronous reset signal `reset` that sets the state to `IDLE` when asserted.'}
