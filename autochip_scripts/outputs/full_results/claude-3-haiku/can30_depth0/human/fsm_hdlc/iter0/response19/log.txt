{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences specified in the problem:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output asserted)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output asserted)
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (`err` output asserted)

The module has the following states:
- `WAIT`: Waiting for the next input bit
- `DISC`: Detected 5 consecutive 1s, need to discard the next bit
- `FLAG`: Detected 6 consecutive 1s, this is a flag
- `ERR`: Detected 7 or more consecutive 1s, this is an error

The module updates the state and the output signals based on the current state and the input bit. The reset signal sets the module to the `WAIT` state and resets the output signals.'}
