{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets).

To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

The Verilog code above implements the required Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences as described in the problem statement. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `reset`: Synchronous reset signal (active high)
- `in`: Input bit stream

Outputs:
- `disc`: Indicates that a bit needs to be discarded
- `flag`: Indicates the beginning/end of a frame
- `err`: Indicates an error (7 or more consecutive 1s)

The module uses four states to implement the required functionality:
- `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the first 1 bit
- `FIVE_ONE`: Detected 5 consecutive 1 bits, waiting for the next bit
- `FLAG`: Detected the 6 consecutive 1 bits (flag), transitioning back to `IDLE`
- `ERROR`: Detected 7 or more consecutive 1 bits, transitioning back to `IDLE`

The `next_state` logic and output signal generation are handled in the combinational always block. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset signal is used to reset the state to `IDLE`.'}
