The implementation of the function `f` based on the provided Karnaugh map is as follows:

1. The function `f` is defined as a combinational logic output in the `top_module`.
2. An `always_comb` block is used to evaluate the function `f` based on the input `x`.
3. Inside the `case` statement, the conditions for each input combination are checked, and the corresponding output value is assigned to `f`.
4. For the don't-care conditions (represented by `d` in the Karnaugh map), the output is set to `1'b0`, as this is a convenient choice.
5. The `default` case handles any other input combinations not explicitly specified in the `case` statement, and also sets the output to `1'b0`.

This implementation covers all the input combinations and produces the desired output based on the given Karnaugh map.'}
