{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `top_module` takes in the following inputs:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `load`: A signal that indicates when the system should be loaded with the initial data.
   - `data`: The 512-bit initial state of the system.
   - `q`: The 512-bit output representing the current state of the system.

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the provided `data`.
4. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of each cell in `q` is computed using the Rule 90 logic. The logic is implemented in a `for` loop that iterates over the 512 cells.
   - For the first cell (`i == 0`), the previous cell value is assumed to be 0 (off) since the boundary condition is 0.
   - For the last cell (`i == 511`), the next cell value is also assumed to be 0 (off) since the boundary condition is 0.
   - For all other cells, the next state is the XOR of the current cell and the next cell.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the Rule 90 cellular automaton as specified in the problem statement.'}
