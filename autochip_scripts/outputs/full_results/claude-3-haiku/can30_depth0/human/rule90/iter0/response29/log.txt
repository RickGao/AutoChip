{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton system. The module has the following features:

1. The `top_module` takes the following inputs:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `load`: When `load` is high, the module loads the state of the system from the `data` input.
   - `data`: A 512-bit vector that represents the initial state of the system.
2. The output `q` is a 512-bit vector that represents the current state of the system.
3. The `always` block updates the state of the system on every positive edge of the clock signal.
   - If `load` is high, the state is simply loaded from the `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of each cell using the Rule 90 cellular automaton.
     - For the first cell (`i == 0`), the left neighbor is assumed to be 0 (off).
     - For the last cell (`i == 511`), the right neighbor is assumed to be 0 (off).
     - For all other cells, the next state is computed as the XOR of the left and right neighbors.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton system is updated correctly on every clock cycle, and the state can be loaded from the `data` input when the `load` signal is high.'}
