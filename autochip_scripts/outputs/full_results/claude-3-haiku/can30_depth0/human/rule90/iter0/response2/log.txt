{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as requested. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` has the following ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input.
   - `load`: The signal to load the initial state from `data`.
   - `data`: The 512-bit input data to be loaded into the system.
   - `q`: The 512-bit output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. Inside the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock (`@(posedge clk)`), the module handles two cases:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is loaded with the `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton logic:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
     - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0, assuming the boundary condition is that the outer cells are always off (0).
     - For the rest of the cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is computed as the XOR of the two neighboring cells (`q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`).

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell system based on the Rule 90 cellular automaton rules, assuming the boundary conditions are that the outer cells are always off (0).'}
