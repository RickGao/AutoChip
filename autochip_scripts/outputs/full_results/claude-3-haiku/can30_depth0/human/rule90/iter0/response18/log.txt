This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The `top_module` takes the following inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal
- `load`: If `load` is high, the module will load the state from the `data` input
- `data`: A 512-bit input that represents the initial state of the cellular automaton

The module outputs a 512-bit `q` signal, which represents the current state of the cellular automaton.

The module uses an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `load` signal is high, the module loads the state from the `data` input. Otherwise, the module computes the next state of the cellular automaton using the Rule 90 logic.

The first and last cells are handled separately, as their neighbors are assumed to be always off (0). For the remaining cells, the next state is computed using the XOR of the current cell and its two neighbors.'}
