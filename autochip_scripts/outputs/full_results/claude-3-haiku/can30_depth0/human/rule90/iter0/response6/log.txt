{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as specified. Here's a breakdown of the module:

1. The module takes four inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `load` (load input), `data` (initial state of the 512-cell array), and one output: `q` (the current state of the 512-cell array).

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. If the `load` input is high, the current state `q` is updated with the `data` input.

4. If the `load` input is low, the following logic is executed:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is updated with the state of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is always set to 0 (off) to represent the boundary condition.
   - For all the other cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the new state is calculated as the XOR of the left and right neighboring cells.

This Verilog code correctly implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement.'}
