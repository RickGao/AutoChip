{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This module implements the specified finite state machine with the following states:

- `STATE_A`: The initial state when the reset signal is asserted. The outputs `f` and `g` are set to 0.
- `STATE_B`: After the reset signal is de-asserted, the module sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle and monitors the `x` input.
- `STATE_C`: When the sequence `1, 0, 1` is detected on the `x` input, the module sets `g` to 1 and monitors the `y` input.
- `STATE_D`: If the `y` input becomes 1 within two clock cycles, the module maintains `g` at 1 permanently. Otherwise, it sets `g` to 0 permanently.

The module uses a state register `current_state` to keep track of the current state and a `next_state` register to determine the next state based on the input signals and the current state. The output signals `f` and `g` are set accordingly in each state.'}
