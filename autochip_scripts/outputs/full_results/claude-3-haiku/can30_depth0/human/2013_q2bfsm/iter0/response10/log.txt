{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. Defining the four states of the FSM using localparam constants.
2. Using a state register to keep track of the current state.
3. Implementing the state transition logic in an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the negation of the reset signal.
4. Assigning the appropriate values to the output signals `f` and `g` based on the current state and the input signals `x` and `y`.
5. Handling the reset condition by transitioning to the `STATE_A` when the reset signal is asserted.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the given finite state machine specification.'}
