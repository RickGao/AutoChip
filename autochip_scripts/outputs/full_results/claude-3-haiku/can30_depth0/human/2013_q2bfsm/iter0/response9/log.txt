{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The key changes made are:

1. Defined the states of the FSM using parameters.
2. Added registers to store the history of `x` inputs and the count of clock cycles since `y` became 1.
3. Restructured the `always` blocks to handle the state transitions and output assignments correctly.
4. Ensured that the output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle when the reset is de-asserted.
5. Handled the case where `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles and the case where it does not.

The module should now work according to the given specification.'}
