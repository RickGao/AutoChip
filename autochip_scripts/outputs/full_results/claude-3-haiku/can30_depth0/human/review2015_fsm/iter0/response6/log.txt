This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine described in the problem statement. It has the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Waits for the start sequence (1101) to be detected on the `data` input.
2. **START_DETECT**: Detects the start sequence (1101) on the `data` input.
3. **SHIFT_DURATION**: Shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration of the delay, asserting `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles.
4. **COUNTING**: Asserts the `counting` output to indicate that the timer is counting, and waits for the `done_counting` input to go high.
5. **WAIT_ACK**: Asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out, and waits for the `ack` input to go high before resetting to the IDLE state.

The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to IDLE when `reset` is high.'}
