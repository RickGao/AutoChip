```

This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. The state machine has five states: IDLE, DETECT_PATTERN, SHIFT_DURATION, COUNT, and NOTIFY. The module uses a `shift_count` register to keep track of the number of bits shifted in during the SHIFT_DURATION state. 

In the IDLE state, the module waits for the input pattern 1101. Once the pattern is detected, the state machine moves to the DETECT_PATTERN state, where it continues to shift in bits and increments the `shift_count` register. When the `shift_count` reaches 4, indicating that the duration has been received, the state machine moves to the SHIFT_DURATION state, where it asserts the `shift_ena` output for 4 clock cycles. 

After the duration has been shifted in, the state machine moves to the COUNT state, where it asserts the `counting` output and waits for the `done_counting` input to be asserted, indicating that the counters have finished counting. Once the `done_counting` input is asserted, the state machine moves to the NOTIFY state, where it asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out. The state machine then waits for the `ack` input to be asserted, indicating that the user has acknowledged the timer, before moving back to the IDLE state to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence.

The module also includes a synchronous reset that sets the state to IDLE and resets the other registers.'}
