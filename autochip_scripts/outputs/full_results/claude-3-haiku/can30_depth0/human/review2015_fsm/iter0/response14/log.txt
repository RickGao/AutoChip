The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This module implements the finite-state machine as per the given specifications. It has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start sequence (1101) to be detected.
2. `DETECT_START`: Checks for the start sequence (1101) and transitions to `SHIFT_DELAY` state when detected.
3. `SHIFT_DELAY`: Shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay, and then transitions to `WAIT_TIMER` state.
4. `WAIT_TIMER`: Waits for the counters to finish counting, and then transitions to `NOTIFY_USER` state.
5. `NOTIFY_USER`: Notifies the user that the timer has timed out, and waits for the user to acknowledge (ack) before transitioning back to the `IDLE` state.

The module also has the necessary output signals (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) to control the data path and notify the user.'}
