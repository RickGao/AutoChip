After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The main changes are:

1. Added a state machine with four states: `S_WAIT_START`, `S_SHIFT_DURATION`, `S_COUNT`, and `S_NOTIFY`.
2. In the `S_WAIT_START` state, the state machine checks for the 1101 pattern on the `data` input, and transitions to the `S_SHIFT_DURATION` state when the pattern is detected.
3. In the `S_SHIFT_DURATION` state, the state machine asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles, then transitions to the `S_COUNT` state.
4. In the `S_COUNT` state, the state machine waits for the `done_counting` signal to be asserted, then transitions to the `S_NOTIFY` state and asserts the `done` signal.
5. In the `S_NOTIFY` state, the state machine waits for the `ack` signal to be asserted, then resets itself to the `S_WAIT_START` state.
6. The state machine has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `S_WAIT_START`.'}
