The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine as per the given specification. It has the following states:

1. `STATE_WAIT`: Waits for the start pattern 1101 to be received.
2. `STATE_PATTERN`: Checks if the incoming data matches the start pattern 1101.
3. `STATE_SHIFT`: Shifts in the next 4 bits to determine the duration of the timer.
4. `STATE_COUNT`: Asserts the `counting` output and waits for the counters to finish.
5. `STATE_NOTIFY`: Asserts the `done` output to notify the user, and waits for the user to acknowledge (`ack`) before resetting.

The module also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `STATE_WAIT` and clears all the outputs.'}
