This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer functionality as described in the problem statement. The state machine has five states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the 1101 pattern to be detected on the `data` input.
2. `DETECT_PATTERN`: Asserts the `shift_ena` output to indicate that the 1101 pattern has been detected and the duration needs to be shifted in.
3. `SHIFT_DURATION`: Shifts in the 4 bits that determine the duration of the timer.
4. `WAIT_COUNTING`: Asserts the `counting` output to indicate that the state machine is waiting for the counters to finish counting.
5. `NOTIFY_USER`: Asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out, and waits for the user to acknowledge (`ack`) before resetting to the `IDLE` state.

The state machine also has a synchronous reset functionality that sets the state to `IDLE` when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
