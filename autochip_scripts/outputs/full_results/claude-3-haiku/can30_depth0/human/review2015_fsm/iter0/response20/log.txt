After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer functionality as described in the problem statement.

The module has the following inputs and outputs:
- `clk`: Clock input
- `reset`: Synchronous reset input
- `data`: Serial data input
- `done_counting`: Input indicating the counters have finished counting
- `ack`: Input indicating the user has acknowledged the timer timeout

The module has the following outputs:
- `shift_ena`: Output that is asserted for 4 clock cycles after the 1101 pattern is detected
- `counting`: Output that is asserted while the counters are running
- `done`: Output that is asserted when the timer has timed out, and is cleared when the user acknowledges the timeout

The module uses a 4-bit state register to keep track of the current state of the state machine. The possible states are:
- `SEARCH`: Searching for the 1101 pattern on the `data` input
- `SHIFT`: Shifting in 4 more bits to determine the timer duration
- `COUNT`: Waiting for the counters to finish counting
- `NOTIFY`: Notifying the user that the timer has timed out and waiting for acknowledgement
- `WAIT`: Default state

The state machine transitions between these states based on the inputs and outputs, as described in the problem statement.'}
