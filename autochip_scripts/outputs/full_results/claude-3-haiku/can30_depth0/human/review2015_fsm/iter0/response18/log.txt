This finite-state machine implementation handles the four requirements you specified:

1. When the pattern 1101 is detected, the state machine transitions to the `STATE_DETECT_PATTERN` and asserts the `shift_ena` output.
2. The state machine then transitions to the `STATE_SHIFT_DURATION` state, continuing to assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration.
3. After the duration has been shifted in, the state machine transitions to the `STATE_COUNTING` state and asserts the `counting` output.
4. When the counters finish (`done_counting` is high), the state machine transitions to the `STATE_NOTIFY` state, asserts the `done` output, and waits for the user acknowledgment (`ack`) before resetting to the `STATE_IDLE` state.

The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `STATE_IDLE` when the `reset` input is high.'}
