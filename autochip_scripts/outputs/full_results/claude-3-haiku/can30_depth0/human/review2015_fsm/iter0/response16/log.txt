This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine described in the problem statement. It has the following states:

1. `WAIT_START`: Waits for the 1101 pattern to be detected on the `data` input.
2. `SHIFT_BITS`: Shifts in 4 more bits after the 1101 pattern is detected, and transitions to the next state when the 4 bits have been shifted in.
3. `WAIT_DONE`: Asserts the `counting` output and waits for the `done_counting` input to go high, indicating that the counting is complete.
4. `NOTIFY`: Asserts the `done` output to notify the user, and waits for the `ack` input to go high before resetting to the `WAIT_START` state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START` when the `reset` input is high.'}
