The Verilog module provided implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has three states: A, B, and C.
2. The module starts in state A and remains there as long as `s` is 0.
3. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to state B.
4. In state B, the module examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.
5. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the module sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle.
6. If `w` is not 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles, the module sets `z` to 0 in the following clock cycle.
7. The module continues checking `w` for the next three clock cycles, and so on.
8. The reset signal is handled synchronously, and upon reset, the module transitions to state A and sets `z` to 0.'}
