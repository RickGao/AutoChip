The finite state machine has three states:
- State A: The initial state where the FSM waits for `s` to become 1.
- State B: The state where the FSM checks the value of `w` for three clock cycles.
- State C: The state where the FSM continues checking the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.

The FSM starts in state A. When `s` is 1, it transitions to state B and starts counting the number of times `w` is 1 over the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

The FSM then transitions to state C, where it continues checking the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles, and then goes back to state B to repeat the process.

The `reset` signal is used to reset the FSM to the initial state A.'}
