The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.
2. In state A, the FSM remains in this state as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.
3. In state B, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle (state C). Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
4. After state C, the FSM transitions back to state B and continues the process of checking the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.
5. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, and when `reset` is high, the FSM is set to the initial state A, and the output `z` is set to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to perform the given functionality.'}
