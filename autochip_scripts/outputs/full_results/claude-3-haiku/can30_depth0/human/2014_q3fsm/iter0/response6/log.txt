The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should implement the desired finite state machine behavior. The module uses three states: `A`, `B`, and `C`, where:

- State `A` is the reset state, where the FSM remains as long as `s` is 0.
- State `B` is entered when `s` becomes 1, and the module starts counting the number of times `w` is 1 in the next three clock cycles.
- State `C` is used to continue checking the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles, after the initial check in state `B`.

The `z` output is set to 1 in the clock cycle following the one where `w` was 1 in exactly two of the previous three clock cycles. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

The module correctly handles the reset condition and the state transitions based on the input `s` and the counted number of times `w` is 1.'}
