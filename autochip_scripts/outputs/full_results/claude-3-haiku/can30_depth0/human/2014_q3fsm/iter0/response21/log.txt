The finite state machine has the following states:
- State A: Initial reset state, stays in A as long as s = 0, transitions to B when s = 1.
- State B: Counts the number of w = 1 inputs over the next 3 clock cycles, transitions to C when 3 clock cycles have passed.
- State C: Sets the output z = 1 if w = 1 in exactly 2 out of the 3 clock cycles, otherwise z = 0, then transitions to D.
- State D: Resets the w_count and transitions back to B to start the next set of 3 clock cycles.

The module handles the reset signal properly, and the state machine transitions correctly based on the inputs s and w.'}
