This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. It uses three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`. The module keeps track of the input `w` using the `w_count` variable, which counts the number of times `w` is 1 in the last three clock cycles. The output `z` is set to 1 if `w_count` is 2, and 0 otherwise.

The module also handles the synchronous reset signal `reset`, which sets the state to `STATE_A` and resets the `w_count` and `z` variables.'}
