This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has three states: A (reset state), B (checking the 'w' input), and C (unused). 

The module uses a 2-bit `state` variable to keep track of the current state, and a 2-bit `count` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles since entering state B.

In the reset state (A), the module waits for the `s` input to become 1, at which point it transitions to state B and resets the `count` variable.

In state B, the module increments the `count` variable on each clock cycle. Once the `count` variable reaches 3 (indicating that the 'w' input has been observed for the last 3 clock cycles), the module checks the value of the 'w' input. If 'w' was 1 in exactly two of the last three clock cycles, the module sets the `z` output to 1. Otherwise, it sets `z` to 0. The module then transitions back to state A and resets the `count` variable.'}
