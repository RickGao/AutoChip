The Verilog code above implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C. 

- In state A, the FSM remains in this state as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it transitions to state B.
- In state B, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w = 1` in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
- After the three clock cycles in state B, the FSM transitions back to state A.

The code uses a `count` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles in state B, and the `state` variable to keep track of the current state of the FSM. The `reset` input is used to reset the FSM to the initial state A.'}
