The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) with the specified behavior. The module has four states:

1. `STATE_A`: The reset state where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, the FSM transitions to `STATE_B`.
2. `STATE_B`: In this state, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. It keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w = 1` using the `w_count` register.
3. `STATE_C`: This is a temporary state that the FSM moves to from `STATE_B` before transitioning back to `STATE_B` for the next set of three clock cycles.

The `z` output is set to `1` in the clock cycle following the three clock cycles where `w = 1` exactly two times. Otherwise, `z` is set to `0`.

The `reset` input is handled synchronously, and the FSM returns to the `STATE_A` reset state when `reset` is high.'}
