The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles.

The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has three states: A (reset state), B (checking w for 3 clock cycles), and C (waiting for the next 3 clock cycles). The module uses a 2-bit state register to keep track of the current state, and a 2-bit count register to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the current state.

In the reset state (A), the module waits for the s input to become 1, at which point it transitions to state B. In state B, the module checks the w input for 3 clock cycles, and sets the output z to 1 if w is 1 in exactly 2 of those 3 clock cycles. After the 3 clock cycles, the module transitions to state C, where it waits for the next 3 clock cycles before transitioning back to state B.'}
