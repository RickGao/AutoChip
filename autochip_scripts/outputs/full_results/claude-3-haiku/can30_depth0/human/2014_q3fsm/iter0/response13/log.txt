The finite state machine has two states, A and B, to represent the behavior described in the problem statement. 

In state A, the FSM remains in this state as long as the `s` input is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.

In state B, the FSM checks the `w` input for the next three clock cycles. It keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w` was 1 using the `count` variable. If `w` was 1 in exactly two out of the three clock cycles, the `z` output is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0. After the three clock cycles, the FSM transitions back to state B to check the next three clock cycles of `w`.

The reset signal sets the state to A and resets the `count` and `z` variables.'}
