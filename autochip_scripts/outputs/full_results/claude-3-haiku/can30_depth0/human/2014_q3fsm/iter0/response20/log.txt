The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following key components:

1. State variables:
   - `state`: Represents the current state of the FSM. The possible states are A, B, and C.
   - `next_state`: Represents the next state of the FSM, which is determined based on the current state and the input `s`.
   - `w_count`: Keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 while the FSM is in state B.

2. Reset handling:
   - When the `reset` input is high, the FSM is set to the initial state A, the `w_count` is reset to 0, and the output `z` is set to 0.

3. State transition logic:
   - In state A, the FSM transitions to state B when `s` is 1, otherwise it remains in state A.
   - In state B, the FSM transitions back to state A when `w_count` reaches 3 (i.e., `w` was 1 in exactly 2 out of the last 3 clock cycles).

4. Output logic:
   - The output `z` is set to 1 when the FSM is in state B and `w_count` is 2 (i.e., `w` was 1 in exactly 2 out of the last 3 clock cycles). Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

This Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement, using the minimum number of states.'}
