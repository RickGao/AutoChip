The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The key aspects of the design are:

1. The FSM has three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C` (which is the default state).
2. In `STATE_A`, the FSM checks the `s` input and transitions to `STATE_B` if `s` is 1, otherwise it stays in `STATE_A`.
3. In `STATE_B`, the FSM checks the `w` input for three clock cycles and counts the number of times `w` is 1. If `w` is 1 exactly two times, the `z` output is set to 1 in the next clock cycle.
4. The `w_count` variable keeps track of the number of clock cycles in `STATE_B` and is reset when transitioning back to `STATE_A`.
5. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously and resets the FSM to `STATE_A` and sets `z` to 0.

This design uses the minimum number of states (2) to implement the given finite state machine.'}
