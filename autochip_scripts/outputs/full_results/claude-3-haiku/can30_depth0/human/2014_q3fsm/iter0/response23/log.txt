{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine with inputs s and w. Assume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below. The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The key aspects of the corrected Verilog module are:
1. The module has three states: A (reset state), B (checking w for 3 cycles), and C (output z set to 1 if w=1 in 2 of 3 cycles).
2. The state transitions are handled in the case statement, with appropriate updates to the count register.
3. The output z is set to 1 in state C if the count is 2, and set to 0 in other cases.
4. The reset logic resets the state, count, and output z.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states (3) to satisfy the given FSM specification.'}
