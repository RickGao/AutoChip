{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module implements a Moore state machine with two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`. The module takes in two inputs, `bump_left` and `bump_right`, and outputs two signals, `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which indicate the Lemming's direction of movement.

The key changes are:

1. Declared `state` as a register to store the current state of the Lemming.
2. Initialized the state to `WALK_LEFT` and set the corresponding output signals in the `areset` block.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the `case` statement:
   - If the Lemming is in the `WALK_LEFT` state and `bump_right` is high, it transitions to the `WALK_RIGHT` state.
   - If the Lemming is in the `WALK_RIGHT` state and `bump_left` is high, it transitions to the `WALK_LEFT` state.
4. Updated the output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` based on the current state.
5. Added a `default` case to handle any unspecified state.

This implementation ensures that the Lemming switches directions correctly based on the input signals `bump_left` and `bump_right`, and the module resets to the `WALK_LEFT` state when the `areset` signal is high.'}
