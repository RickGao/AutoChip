{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings game behavior using a Moore state machine. The module has the following features:

1. The module has two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the Lemming walking left or right, respectively.
2. The module has two inputs: `bump_left` and `bump_right`, which indicate when the Lemming hits an obstacle on the left or right side, respectively.
3. The module has two outputs: `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which indicate the current direction of the Lemming.
4. The module uses a register `state` to keep track of the current state.
5. The `always` block handles the state transitions and updates the output signals based on the current state and input signals.
6. The module is reset to the `LEFT` state when the `areset` signal is active.

The module correctly models the behavior described in the problem statement.'}
