{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the described Lemmings state machine behavior. The module has the following features:

1. It uses a `localparam` to define the two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`.
2. The `state` and `next_state` registers are used to keep track of the current state and the next state, respectively.
3. The `always` block with `posedge clk, posedge areset` updates the `state` register based on the `next_state` value, and also handles the asynchronous reset (`areset`).
4. The second `always` block with `(*)` sensitivity list calculates the `next_state` based on the current `state` and the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs.
5. The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set based on the current `state`.

This implementation correctly models the Lemmings behavior as described in the problem statement.'}
