{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The module has two states: `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming walking left or right, respectively.

The `always` block with the `posedge clk` and `posedge areset` conditions updates the current state based on the asynchronous reset signal (`areset`) and the next state (`next_state`) calculated in the combinatorial logic block.

The combinatorial logic block (`always @(*)`) determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals (`bump_left` and `bump_right`). It also sets the output signals (`walk_left` and `walk_right`) based on the current state.

If the Lemming is in the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state and it is bumped on the right (`bump_right`), it will transition to the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state. If it is in the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state and it is bumped on the left (`bump_left`), it will transition to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state. If the Lemming is bumped on both sides simultaneously, it will still switch directions.

The module also includes a default case in the `case` statement to ensure that the state machine is initialized to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state when the reset signal (`areset`) is asserted.'}
