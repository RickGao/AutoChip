{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has the following ports:

- `clk`: The clock input.
- `areset`: The asynchronous reset input, which resets the Lemming machine to walk left.
- `bump_left`: The input that indicates a bump on the left side.
- `bump_right`: The input that indicates a bump on the right side.
- `walk_left`: The output that indicates the Lemming is walking left.
- `walk_right`: The output that indicates the Lemming is walking right.

The module has two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming walking left and right, respectively. The state transitions are determined by the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs. If the Lemming is walking left (`state` is `LEFT`) and receives a bump on the right (`bump_right`), it will transition to the `RIGHT` state. If the Lemming is walking right (`state` is `RIGHT`) and receives a bump on the left (`bump_left`), it will transition to the `LEFT` state.

The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are updated based on the current state. When the Lemming is in the `LEFT` state, `walk_left` is set to 1 and `walk_right` is set to 0. When the Lemming is in the `RIGHT` state, `walk_left` is set to 0 and `walk_right` is set to 1.

The module also handles the asynchronous reset (`areset`) by setting the state to `LEFT` and the outputs accordingly.'}
