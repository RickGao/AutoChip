{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the Lemmings finite state machine behavior as described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. The module has two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the Lemming's walking direction.
2. The module uses a `current_state` register to keep track of the current state and a `next_state` signal to determine the next state.
3. The `always` block with `posedge clk, posedge areset` updates the `current_state` register based on the `next_state` signal and the `areset` input.
4. The combinational `always` block updates the `next_state` and the output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` based on the `current_state` and the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs.
5. If the `bump_left` input is high, the Lemming switches to the `RIGHT` state, and if the `bump_right` input is high, the Lemming switches to the `LEFT` state.
6. The `areset` input asynchronously resets the Lemming to the `LEFT` state.

This implementation should correctly model the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
