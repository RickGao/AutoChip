{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The module has two states, `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming's direction of movement. The current state is stored in the `state` register.

The `always` block handles the state transition logic. If the `areset` signal is high, the module is reset to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state, with `walk_left` set to 1 and `walk_right` set to 0.

In the normal operation, the module checks the current state and the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs to determine the next state. If the Lemming is in the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state and `bump_right` is high, the state transitions to `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`. Similarly, if the Lemming is in the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state and `bump_left` is high, the state transitions to `STATE_WALK_LEFT`. The output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` are updated accordingly.

The default case in the `case` statement ensures that if the module is in an unexpected state, it will revert to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state.'}
