{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The module has two inputs, `bump_left` and `bump_right`, which indicate if the Lemming has hit an obstacle on the left or right side, respectively. The module has two outputs, `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which indicate the direction the Lemming is currently walking.

The module has two states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming walking left or right, respectively. The module starts in the `LEFT` state, with `walk_left` set to `1` and `walk_right` set to `0`.

The module uses an `always` block to update the state and output values based on the current state and the values of `bump_left` and `bump_right`. If the Lemming is in the `LEFT` state and `bump_right` is `1`, the module transitions to the `RIGHT` state. If the Lemming is in the `RIGHT` state and `bump_left` is `1`, the module transitions to the `LEFT` state.

The module also includes a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset, `areset`, which resets the module to the `LEFT` state and sets `walk_left` to `1` and `walk_right` to `0`.'}
