This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.

The corrected Verilog module represents the given Finite State Machine (FSM) description. It includes the following:

1. State codes defined using `localparam` for the four states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.
2. State registers (`state_reg` and `state_next`) to store the current and next states.
3. The state table implemented in a combinational always block, which updates the `state_next` based on the current state and the input signals `r[3:1]`.
4. The state flip-flops implemented in a sequential always block, which updates the `state_reg` based on the `state_next` and the active-low synchronous reset `resetn`.
5. The output logic, which assigns the grant signals `g[3:1]` based on the current state.

This completed Verilog module should correctly implement the given FSM description.'}
