The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximum-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should reset to 1 on an active-high synchronous reset signal.

The completed Verilog module implements this functionality. The `always` block handles the behavior of the LFSR. On a positive edge of the `clk` signal, or when the `reset` signal is high, the module updates the state of the LFSR:

1. If `reset` is high, the LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001`, resetting the output to 1.
2. Otherwise, the LFSR shifts the existing bits one position to the right (`q[4:1] <= q[3:0]`), and the new least significant bit (`q[0]`) is computed by XORing the most significant bit (`q[4]`) and the bit at position 3 (`q[2]`), as specified by the taps at positions 5 and 3.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through all possible states (except the all-zero state) before repeating, as required for a maximum-length LFSR.'}
