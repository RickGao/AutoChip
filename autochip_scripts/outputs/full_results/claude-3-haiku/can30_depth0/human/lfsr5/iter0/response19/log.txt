The provided Verilog module is a 5-bit Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, as specified in the problem statement. The module includes the following features:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (active-high synchronous reset).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 5-bit register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
3. The `next_q` register is used to store the next state of the LFSR.
4. In the first `always` block, the current state `q` is updated on the positive edge of the clock, or when the `reset` input is high. If `reset` is high, the LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001`.
5. In the second `always` block, the next state of the LFSR is calculated. The new most significant bit (`next_q[4]`) is the XOR of the current least significant bit (`q[0]`) and the bit at position 3 (`q[2]`), as per the Galois LFSR configuration. The remaining bits (`next_q[3:0]`) are shifted one position to the right.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through all possible non-zero states (31 states) before repeating, as required for a maximum-length LFSR.'}
