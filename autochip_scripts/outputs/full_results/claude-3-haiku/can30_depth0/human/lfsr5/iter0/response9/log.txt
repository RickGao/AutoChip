{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

This 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR has the following features:

1. The taps are at bit positions 5 and 3, as specified in the problem statement.
2. The LFSR is reset to the value 1 (00001) when the `reset` input is active high.
3. On each clock cycle, the register is shifted one bit to the right, and the new LSB is computed by XORing the values at the tapped bit positions (4 and 2).
4. The LFSR will cycle through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
