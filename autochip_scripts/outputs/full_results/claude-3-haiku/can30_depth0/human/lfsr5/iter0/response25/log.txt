The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have an active-high synchronous reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The completed Verilog module addresses the given specification as follows:

1. The module defines a `next_q` register to hold the next state of the LFSR.
2. In the combinational logic block (`always @(*)`), the next state is calculated by XORing the 3rd and 0th bits (corresponding to the taps at positions 5 and 3) and shifting the rest of the bits one position to the right.
3. In the sequential logic block (`always @(posedge clk)`), the LFSR state is updated on the positive edge of the clock. If the `reset` signal is active, the LFSR output `q` is reset to `5'b00001`, which is the initial state with the least significant bit set to 1. Otherwise, the LFSR state is updated with the next state calculated in the combinational logic block.

This implementation ensures the LFSR meets the given specification of a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with the appropriate tap positions and a synchronous reset to the initial state.'}
