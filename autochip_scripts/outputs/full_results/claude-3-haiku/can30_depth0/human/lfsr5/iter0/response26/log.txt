The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have an active-high synchronous reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implementation is as follows:

1. The module has two always blocks:
   - The first always block updates the current state `q` on the positive edge of the clock, with the reset condition setting `q` to `5'b00001`.
   - The second always block calculates the next state `next_q` based on the current state `q`. The new bit 0 is calculated as the XOR of bits 4 and 2, and the remaining bits are shifted one position to the right.

2. The module uses a registered output `q` to ensure that the LFSR output is updated synchronously with the clock.

This implementation should correctly implement the desired 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with the specified tap positions and reset behavior.'}
