The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximum-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The module has a synchronous active-high reset that sets the LFSR output to 1.

The completed Verilog module implements the described functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` has three ports: `clk` (the clock input), `reset` (the active-high synchronous reset input), and `q` (the 5-bit LFSR output).
2. The `always` block inside the module updates the LFSR state on the positive edge of the clock or when the reset signal is active.
3. If the `reset` signal is active, the LFSR output `q` is initialized to `5'b00001`.
4. If the `reset` signal is not active, the LFSR is updated as follows:
   - The bits `q[4:1]` are shifted one position to the right, effectively shifting the LFSR.
   - The new least significant bit `q[0]` is computed by XORing the most significant bit `q[4]` and the bit at position 2 `q[2]`, which corresponds to the tap positions 5 and 3.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through the maximum-length sequence of 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique non-zero states before repeating, as required by the specification.'}
