{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The main changes made are:

1. Added a `reg` output `done` to signal the completion of a message.
2. Defined the state machine with 4 states: `IDLE`, `RECV1`, `RECV2`, and `RECV3`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the state transitions to `RECV1` if `in[3]` is 1, indicating the start of a new message.
4. In the `RECV1`, `RECV2`, and `RECV3` states, the state transitions to the next state, until reaching `RECV3`, where the `done` signal is set to 1.
5. The `default` case resets the state to `IDLE` and clears the `done` signal.
6. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, setting the state to `IDLE` and clearing the `done` signal.

This module should correctly detect and signal the completion of a PS/2 mouse protocol message.'}
