{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The above Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The main features are:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in[7:0]`, and `reset`. The `done` signal is the output.
2. The module uses four states to track the progress of the message reception: `WAIT_BYTE1`, `RECEIVE_BYTE1`, `RECEIVE_BYTE2`, and `RECEIVE_BYTE3`.
3. In the `WAIT_BYTE1` state, the module waits for a byte with `in[3] = 1`, which indicates the start of a new message. Once such a byte is received, the state transitions to `RECEIVE_BYTE1`.
4. In the `RECEIVE_BYTE1`, `RECEIVE_BYTE2`, and `RECEIVE_BYTE3` states, the module simply transitions to the next state, without any additional logic.
5. Once the third byte has been received in the `RECEIVE_BYTE3` state, the module sets the `done` signal to `1` and transitions back to the `WAIT_BYTE1` state, ready to process the next message.
6. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `WAIT_BYTE1` and the `done` signal to `0`.

This implementation should correctly process the input byte stream and signal the completion of each three-byte message.'}
