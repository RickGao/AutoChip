{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module above implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The key features are:

1. The module has three states: `STATE_WAIT_FIRST`, `STATE_WAIT_SECOND`, and `STATE_WAIT_THIRD`, which correspond to waiting for the first, second, and third bytes of the PS/2 mouse protocol message, respectively.

2. The `byte_count` variable keeps track of the current position within the 3-byte message.

3. The `done` output is set to 1 in the cycle immediately after the third byte of the message is successfully received.

4. The module resets the state machine and `done` output when the `reset` input is active high.

The module should correctly parse the input byte stream and signal the receipt of a complete 3-byte message as per the problem statement.'}
