{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine that searches for message boundaries in a continuous byte stream. The module takes in an 8-bit input `in`, a clock signal `clk`, and a reset signal `reset`, and outputs a `done` signal when a complete 3-byte message has been received.

The module has four states:
1. `WAIT_FOR_START`: The module waits for a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a new message.
2. `RECV_BYTE1`: The module has detected the first byte of the message and transitions to the next state.
3. `RECV_BYTE2`: The module has received the second byte of the message and transitions to the next state.
4. `RECV_BYTE3`: The module has received the third byte of the message and sets the `done` signal high, then transitions back to the `WAIT_FOR_START` state.

The module uses a synchronous reset mechanism, where the state is reset to `WAIT_FOR_START` and the `done` signal is set to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
