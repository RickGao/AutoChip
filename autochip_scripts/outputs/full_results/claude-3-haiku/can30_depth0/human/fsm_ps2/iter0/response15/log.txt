{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module addresses the following issues:

1. Declared a `done` output register to signal the completion of a message.
2. Defined the state machine with four states: `IDLE`, `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `BYTE3`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the module checks if the MSB of the input byte is set (`in[3]`). If it is, the next state is set to `BYTE1`, indicating the start of a message. Otherwise, the module remains in the `IDLE` state.
4. In the `BYTE1` state, the module transitions to the `BYTE2` state.
5. In the `BYTE2` state, the module transitions to the `BYTE3` state.
6. In the `BYTE3` state, the module sets the `done` output to `1'b1` to signal the completion of a message, and then transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
7. The state transitions are handled in the `always @(*)` block, which implements the combinational logic of the state machine.
8. The state register is updated synchronously with the clock and reset signal in the `always @(posedge clk)` block.'}
