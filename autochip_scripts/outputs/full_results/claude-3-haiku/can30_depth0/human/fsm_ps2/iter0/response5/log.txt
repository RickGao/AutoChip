{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module provided correctly implements the finite state machine to detect the three-byte message boundaries in the input byte stream based on the given specification. The module has the following features:

1. It has three states: `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, and `WAIT_THIRD`, which correspond to the three bytes of the message.
2. The `state` register keeps track of the current state of the FSM.
3. In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, the module checks if the most significant bit (bit 3) of the input byte is set to 1. If so, it transitions to the `WAIT_SECOND` state.
4. In the `WAIT_SECOND` state, the module simply transitions to the `WAIT_THIRD` state.
5. In the `WAIT_THIRD` state, the module sets the `done` output to 1 to signal the successful reception of a complete message. It then transitions back to the `WAIT_FIRST` state.
6. The `reset` input is implemented as a synchronous reset, which resets the `state` register to `WAIT_FIRST` and the `done` output to 0.

This Verilog module should correctly handle the given PS/2 mouse protocol and signal the completion of each message.'}
