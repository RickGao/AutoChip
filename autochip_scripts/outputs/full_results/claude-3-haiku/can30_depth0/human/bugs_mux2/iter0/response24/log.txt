The issue with the original code was that the `assign` statement was not correct for an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer. The correct implementation should use a `always` block with an `if-else` statement to assign the appropriate input based on the `sel` signal.

In the corrected module, the `out` signal is declared as a `reg` type, and the logic for selecting between `a` and `b` is implemented inside the `always` block using an `if-else` statement. This ensures that the 8-bit wide output `out` is correctly assigned based on the value of the `sel` input.'}
