The original code had a bug where the assignment to the output `out` was not correct. The `~sel & a` and `sel & b` expressions were not properly combined to select the correct input.

The corrected code uses a conditional statement (`if-else`) to select the correct input based on the value of `sel`. When `sel` is 1, the output `out` is assigned the value of `b`, and when `sel` is 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of `a`.

This corrected code will correctly implement an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer.'}
