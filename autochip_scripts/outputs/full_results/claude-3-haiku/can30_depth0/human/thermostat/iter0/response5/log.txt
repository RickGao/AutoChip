The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It uses a single `always` block to handle the logic for both heating and cooling modes.

In heating mode (`mode = 1`), the module turns on the heater when `too_cold` is 1, and turns on the fan when either the heater is on or `fan_on` is 1. The air conditioner is kept off in this mode.

In cooling mode (`mode = 0`), the module turns on the air conditioner when `too_hot` is 1, and turns on the fan when either the air conditioner is on or `fan_on` is 1. The heater is kept off in this mode.

The `reg` declaration for the output signals ensures that they are treated as registers, which is necessary for the module to synthesize correctly.'}
