Implement a circuit that will turn on and off the heater, air conditioning, and blower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the heater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air conditioner. In cooling mode, turn the air conditioner on when it is too hot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn on the heater. When the heater or air conditioner are on, also turn on the fan to circulate the air. In addition, the user can also request the fan to turn on (fan_on = 1), even if the heater and air conditioner are off.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput mode,\n\tinput too_cold, \n\tinput too_hot,\n\tinput fan_on,\n\toutput heater,\n\toutput aircon,\n\toutput fan\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the desired functionality for the heating/cooling thermostat. The key points are:

1. The module has three outputs: `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan`.
2. The `always @(*)` block handles the different modes of operation (heating and cooling) based on the `mode` input.
3. In heating mode, the `heater` output is set to `too_cold`, and the `fan` output is set to `too_cold | fan_on`.
4. In cooling mode, the `aircon` output is set to `too_hot`, and the `fan` output is set to `too_hot | fan_on`.
5. The `default` case sets the `heater` and `aircon` outputs to `0`, and the `fan` output to `fan_on`.

The module should now compile and function as expected.'}
