system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top module has 8 inputs and 2 outputs.

The inputs are:
- clk
- load
- ena
- amount[1:0]
- data[63:0]

The outputs are:
- q[63:0]

The top module has 1 always block.

The block is triggered by a rising edge of clk.

The always block has 1 if block.

The if block has a condition load and an else if block.

The else if block has a condition ena and 1 case block.

The case block has 4 case items, 00, 01, 10, 11, and 1 default item.

The case item 00 has 1 assignment.

The assignment is q = {q[62:0], 1'b0}

The case item 01 has 1 assignment.

The assignment is q = {q[55:0], 8'b0}

The case item 10 has 1 assignment.

The assignment is q = {q[63], q[63:1]}

The case item 11 has 1 assignment.

The assignment is q = {{8{q[63]}}, q[63:8]}

The default item has 1 assignment.

The assignment is q = 64'hx
