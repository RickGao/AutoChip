The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` has 10 ports, 6 inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) and 4 outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`).
2. The output `w` is assigned by concatenating the 5-bit input `a` with the 3-bit constant `3'b111`.
3. The output `x` is assigned by concatenating the 5-bit input `b` with the 3-bit constant `3'b111`.
4. The output `y` is assigned by concatenating the 5-bit input `c` with the 3-bit constant `3'b111`.
5. The output `z` is assigned by concatenating the 5-bit input `d`, the 5-bit input `e`, the 5-bit input `f`, and the 2-bit constant `2'b11`.'}
