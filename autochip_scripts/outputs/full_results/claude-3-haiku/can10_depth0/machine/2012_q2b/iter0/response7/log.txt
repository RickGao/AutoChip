The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the corresponding completed Verilog module is shown above. The module takes in a 6-bit input vector `y` and a single-bit input `w`, and outputs two signals `Y1` and `Y3` based on the logic described in the specification.

The `Y1` output is assigned the logical AND of the first bit of the input vector `y` and the single-bit input `w`. The `Y3` output is assigned the logical AND of the logical OR of the second, third, fifth, and sixth bits of the input vector `y` and the logical NOT of the single-bit input `w`.'}
