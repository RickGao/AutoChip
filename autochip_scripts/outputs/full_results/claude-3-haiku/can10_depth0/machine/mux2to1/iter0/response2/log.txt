The original Verilog module specification is correct, but it was missing the `reg` keyword for the `out` output port. This is necessary because the `out` port is assigned a value inside the `always` block, which requires it to be declared as a register (`reg`) type.

Additionally, I've added a `default` case in the `case` statement to handle the case where the `sel` input is in an undefined state, assigning the `out` port to a high-impedance state (`'bz`).'}
