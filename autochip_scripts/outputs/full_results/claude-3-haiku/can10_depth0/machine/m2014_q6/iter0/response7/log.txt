{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state. The output z is high when the state machine is in state E or F, and is low otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput w,\n\toutput z\n);'}

endmodule
```

The main changes made are:

1. Defined the states as parameters to make the code more readable.
2. Separated the state transition logic and output logic into separate `always` blocks.
3. Correctly handled the state transitions based on the given specifications.
4. Assigned the output `z` based on the current state.
5. Updated the current state on the positive edge of the clock, and reset the state to `A` when the `reset` input is high.

This Verilog module should now correctly implement the state machine as described in the specification.'}
