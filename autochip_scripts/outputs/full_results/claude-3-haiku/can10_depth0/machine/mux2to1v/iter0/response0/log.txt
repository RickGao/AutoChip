The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. The key points are:

1. The output `out` is declared as a `reg` type, as it will be assigned a value inside the `always` block.
2. The `always` block is triggered on any change of the input signals, using the `@(*)` sensitivity list.
3. Inside the `always` block, a `case` statement is used to check the value of the `sel` input and assign the corresponding value to the `out` output.
4. A `default` case is included to assign a default value of all zeros to the `out` output in case `sel` has an unexpected value.

This module implements a simple 1-bit multiplexer, where the 100-bit wide `a` and `b` inputs are selected based on the value of the `sel` input signal, and the selected value is assigned to the 100-bit wide `out` output.'}
