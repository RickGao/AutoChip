This Verilog module correctly implements the comparison of two 2-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and sets the output `z` to 1 if all the bits of `A` are equal to the corresponding bits of `B`, and 0 otherwise.

The module uses a single `always` block that compares the values of `A` and `B` using the equality operator `==`. If the values are equal, the output `z` is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. The `reg` declaration for `z` ensures that it is a writable register-type output.'}
