module top_module (

```

The key changes are:

1. Added the `always @(posedge clk)` block to capture the clock edge and update the output `q` accordingly.
2. In the `if (a)` condition, set `q` to `3'd4` when `a` is 1.
3. In the `else if (q == 3'd6)` condition, set `q` to `3'd0` when `q` is 6 and `a` is 0.
4. In the `else` condition, increment `q` by 1 when `a` is 0 and `q` is not 6.
5. Used `3'd` to explicitly specify the 3-bit width of the constant values.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the Mealy machine behavior as specified.'}
