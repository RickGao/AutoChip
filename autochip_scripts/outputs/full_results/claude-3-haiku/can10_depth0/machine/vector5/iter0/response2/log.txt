The original code had a few issues:
1. The first vector was not being constructed correctly. It should be `{5{~a}}`, `{5{~b}}`, etc. instead of `{5{a}}`, `{5{b}}`, etc.
2. The second vector was not being constructed correctly. It should be `{5{a, b, c, d, e}}` instead of `{5{a}}, {5{b}}, {5{c}}, {5{d}}, {5{e}}`.
3. The bitwise XOR operation was missing.

The corrected code creates the two 25-bit vectors correctly and then computes their bitwise XOR to produce the final output `out`.'}
