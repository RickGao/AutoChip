{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and a 512-bit input data `data`.
2. The output `q` is a 512-bit register that stores the state of the cellular automaton.
3. On the positive edge of the clock, the module checks if the `load` signal is high. If so, it simply loads the `data` input into the `q` register.
4. If `load` is low, the module advances the state of the cellular automaton by one time step, according to the Rule 110 logic.
5. The first and last cells of the automaton are handled separately, as their neighbors are assumed to be 0 (off).
6. The rest of the cells are updated based on the Rule 110 logic, using a `for` loop to iterate through the cells.'}
