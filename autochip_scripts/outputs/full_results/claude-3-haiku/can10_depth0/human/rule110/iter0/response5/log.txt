{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The key aspects of the Verilog code are:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and a 512-bit data input `data`.
2. The module has a 512-bit output `q` that represents the state of the cellular automaton.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
4. If `load` is high, the module loads the state from `data` into `q`.
5. If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton based on the Rule 110 logic:
   - The leftmost cell `q[511]` is always set to 0 (off).
   - The remaining cells `q[510:0]` are shifted one position to the right, effectively advancing the automaton by one time step.
   - The value of the leftmost cell `q[0]` is updated based on the values of `q[1]`, `q[0]`, and `q[511]` (the rightmost cell).
   - The values of the remaining cells `q[1:510]` are updated based on the values of the current cell and its two neighbors.

This implementation correctly implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system, advancing the state by one time step per clock cycle.'}
