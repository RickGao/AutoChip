{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The key steps are:

1. Initialize the `q` register to hold the 512-cell system.
2. In the `always` block, check for the `load` signal. If `load` is high, assign the `data` input to `q`.
3. If `load` is low, implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton:
   - For the first cell `q[0]`, the next state is determined by `q[1]` and `q[0]` using the Rule 110 logic.
   - For the middle cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is determined by `q[i-1]`, `q[i]`, and `q[i+1]` using the Rule 110 logic.
   - For the last cell `q[511]`, the next state is determined by `q[510]` and `q[511]` using the Rule 110 logic.

The boundary conditions `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are assumed to be 0 (off) as per the problem statement.'}
