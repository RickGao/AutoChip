{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a 512-cell cellular automaton based on the Rule 110 transition rules. The key features of the implementation are:

1. The `top_module` has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (a synchronous active-high load signal), and `data` (a 512-bit vector representing the initial state of the system).
2. The `q` output is a 512-bit vector representing the current state of the system.
3. The module uses an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the `data` input.
5. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of the system is computed based on the Rule 110 transition rules:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on the left boundary condition (assumed to be 0) and the values of `q[0]` and `q[1]`.
   - The internal cells `q[1]` to `q[510]` are updated based on the values of `q[i-1]`, `q[i]`, and `q[i+1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is updated based on the values of `q[510]` and `q[511]`, and the right boundary condition (assumed to be 0).

This implementation correctly advances the state of the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton by one time step each clock cycle, and loads the initial state from the `data` input when the `load` signal is high.'}
