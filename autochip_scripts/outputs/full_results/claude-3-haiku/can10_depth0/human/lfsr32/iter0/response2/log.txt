The provided Verilog module specification describes a 32-bit Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The module has a synchronous reset signal that sets the output `q` to `32'h1`.

The completed Verilog module implements the specified LFSR functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` and `reset`, and one output: `q` (a 32-bit register).
2. Inside the `always` block, which triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`), the module performs the following operations:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`.
   - If the `reset` signal is low, the module performs the LFSR logic:
     - The next state of `q` is calculated by shifting the current state one bit to the right, effectively shifting all bits one position to the right.
     - The new leftmost bit (`q[0]`) is calculated by XORing the following bits: `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.
3. The completed module should function as a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps and the synchronous reset behavior.'}
