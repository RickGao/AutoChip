The provided Verilog module implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The module has the following features:

1. The `clk` input is the clock signal.
2. The `reset` input is the active-high synchronous reset signal, which resets the output `q` to `32'h1`.
3. The `q` output is a 32-bit register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
4. The LFSR is implemented using a shift register, where the next state is calculated by XORing the current most significant bit (`q[31]`) with the bits at positions 21, 1, and 0, and then shifting the entire 32-bit value one position to the left.
5. The reset logic sets the output `q` to `32'h1` when the `reset` signal is high.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified Galois LFSR.'}
