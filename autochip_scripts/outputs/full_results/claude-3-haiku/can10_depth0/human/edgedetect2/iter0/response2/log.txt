The Verilog module provided has the following changes:

1. Added the `reg [7:0] in_prev;` line to store the previous input value.
2. In the `always` block, the current input value `in` is stored in the `in_prev` register at the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `anyedge` output is assigned the result of the XOR operation between the current input `in` and the previous input `in_prev`. This will set the output bit for any bit in the input vector that has changed from the previous clock cycle.

This module should correctly detect any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and set the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output.'}
