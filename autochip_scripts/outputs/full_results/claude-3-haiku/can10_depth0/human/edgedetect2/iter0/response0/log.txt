The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `in_prev` register is declared to store the previous value of the `in` input signal.
2. In the `always` block, the `in_prev` register is updated with the current value of `in` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `anyedge` output is assigned the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the current `in` value and the previous `in_prev` value. This will set the corresponding bit in `anyedge` whenever there is a change (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) in the corresponding bit of the `in` input signal.

This approach correctly detects any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`.'}
