The provided Verilog module `top_module` implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. It has the following functionality:

1. The module has the following input ports:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
   - `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
   - `E`: The enable signal for shifting.
   - `L`: The load signal.
2. The module has one output port:
   - `Q`: The output of the flip-flop.
3. The logic is implemented using a single `always` block that operates on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `L` signal is asserted, the value of `R` is loaded into the flip-flop and stored in `Q`.
5. If the `E` signal is asserted, the value of `w` is shifted into the flip-flop and stored in `Q`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the n-bit shift register circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
