The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, it performs the following:
   - Stores the current value of `in` into `in_prev`.
   - Generates the output `pedge` by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current input `in` and the inverse of the previous input `~in_prev`. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit and sets the corresponding bit in `pedge`.'}
