The provided Verilog module correctly implements the requested functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has three ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input.
   - `in`: The 8-bit input vector.
   - `pedge`: The 8-bit output vector that will hold the positive edge detection result.

2. The module declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the `in` vector.

3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`).
   - In this block, the current value of `in` is stored in the `in_prev` register.
   - The `pedge` output is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` value and the bitwise negation of the previous `in_prev` value (`in & ~in_prev`). This effectively sets the output bit to 1 only if the corresponding input bit has changed from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge transitions on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output vector one clock cycle after the transition occurs.'}
