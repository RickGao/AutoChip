This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine accepts input numbers of arbitrary length, and the conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.

The module uses a Moore state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `COMPUTE`, and `DONE`. The `IDLE` state waits for `areset` to be released, the `COMPUTE` state shifts the input bits into an accumulator and computes the 2's complement, and the `DONE` state outputs the final 2's complement result.

The next state logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, and the state update and output logic is implemented in the `always @(posedge clk, posedge areset)` block.'}
