This Verilog module implements the thermostat control logic as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The `mode` input determines whether the thermostat is in heating (mode = 1) or cooling (mode = 0) mode.
2. In heating mode, the `heater` output is turned on when `too_cold` is 1, and the `fan` is turned on when either the `heater` is on or `fan_on` is 1.
3. In cooling mode, the `aircon` output is turned on when `too_hot` is 1, and the `fan` is turned on when either the `aircon` is on or `fan_on` is 1.
4. The `fan` output is set to the appropriate value based on the mode, heater/AC status, and user request (`fan_on`).
5. The outputs are assigned using `always @(*)` to ensure combinational logic.'}
