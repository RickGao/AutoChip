{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Suppose you are designing a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor. Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call (input ring), your circuit must either turn on the ringer (output ringer = 1) or the motor (output motor = 1), but not both. If the phone is in vibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn on the ringer.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput ring, \n\tinput vibrate_mode,\n\toutput ringer,\n\toutput motor\n);"}

This Verilog module implements the desired logic for controlling the ringer and vibration motor based on the input signals `ring` and `vibrate_mode`.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. Use of `output reg` for the `ringer` and `motor` outputs to indicate that they are registered (flip-flop) outputs.
2. In the `always` block, the logic is split based on the `vibrate_mode` input:
   - If `vibrate_mode` is 1, the ringer is turned off (`ringer = 1'b0`) and the motor is turned on (`motor = 1'b1`).
   - If `vibrate_mode` is 0, the ringer is set to the `ring` input (`ringer = ring`) and the motor is set to the inverse of `ring` (`motor = ~ring`). This ensures that when the phone needs to ring, only the ringer or the motor is turned on, but not both.

This Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality.'}
