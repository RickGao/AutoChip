The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It implements the functionality of enabling the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then keeping the shift_ena signal deasserted until the next reset.

The module has three states:
1. Reset state (2'b00): This state is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In this state, the shift_ena signal is asserted, and a counter is initialized to the maximum count (CNT_MAX = 4).
2. Shift enable state (2'b01): In this state, the counter is decremented on each clock cycle, and the shift_ena signal remains asserted. Once the counter reaches 0, the shift_ena signal is deasserted, and the module transitions to the wait state.
3. Wait state (2'b10): In this state, the shift_ena signal remains deasserted until the next reset.

The module uses a state machine to manage the different states and the corresponding behavior of the shift_ena signal.'}
