The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three states: IDLE, SHIFT, and DONE.
2. When the reset signal is asserted, the module enters the IDLE state and asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles.
3. After the 4 clock cycles in the IDLE state, the module transitions to the DONE state and keeps `shift_ena` de-asserted until the next reset.
4. In the SHIFT state, the module asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles.
5. The state transitions are controlled by the `cycle_count` register, which keeps track of the number of clock cycles in the current state.

The module should correctly implement the desired functionality as specified in the comments.'}
