The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `shift_ena` signal as a `reg` type to allow it to be assigned a value.
2. Defined a `localparam` constant `CYCLE_COUNT` to keep track of the number of clock cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. Defined three states in the FSM: `IDLE`, `SHIFT_ACTIVE`, and `SHIFT_COMPLETE`.
4. Implemented the state machine logic to handle the reset and normal operation cases:
   - In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is asserted, and the state transitions to `SHIFT_ACTIVE`.
   - In the `SHIFT_ACTIVE` state, the `shift_ena` signal remains asserted, and the state transitions to `SHIFT_COMPLETE` when the `CYCLE_COUNT` reaches 4.
   - In the `SHIFT_COMPLETE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is deasserted, and the state transitions back to `IDLE`.

This corrected module should now provide the desired functionality of enabling the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and resetting the shift register for 4 cycles on a synchronous reset.'}
