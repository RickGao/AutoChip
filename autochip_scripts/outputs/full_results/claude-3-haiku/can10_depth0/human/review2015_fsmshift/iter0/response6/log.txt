The module you provided is mostly correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The state machine logic was not quite correct. The `SHIFT` state should increment the state counter until it reaches 4 cycles, and then transition to the `DONE` state.
2. The `shift_ena` output was not being properly controlled. It should be asserted for 4 cycles in the `SHIFT` state, and then deasserted in the `DONE` state.

The corrected module is provided above, which should address these issues and provide the desired functionality.'}
