The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. Added a register `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted.
2. In the always block, the module resets the `count` to 0 and asserts `shift_ena` to 1 when `reset` is high.
3. If `count` reaches 3 (binary 11), the module sets `shift_ena` to 0, indicating that the shift enable signal should be disabled.
4. In all other cases, the module increments the `count` and keeps `shift_ena` asserted (1).

This ensures that whenever the module is reset, `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles, and then it is de-asserted until the next reset.'}
