The provided Verilog module is a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 inclusive. It has the following features:

1. The counter is implemented using a 4-bit register `q`.
2. The counter is incremented on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. The `reset` input is active high and synchronous. When `reset` is high, the counter is reset to 1.
4. If the counter reaches the value of 10, it is reset back to 1 on the next clock cycle.
5. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle.

The module is complete and should compile and function correctly as a decade counter.'}
