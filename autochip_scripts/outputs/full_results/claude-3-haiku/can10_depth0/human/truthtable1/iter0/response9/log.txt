The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented using the following Verilog code:

1. The module `top_module` takes three inputs `x3`, `x2`, and `x1`, and produces one output `f`.
2. The output `f` is assigned using a combinational logic expression that implements the given truth table:
   - `(x2 & ~x1)`: This term is true when `x2` is high and `x1` is low, corresponding to the third row of the truth table.
   - `(~x3 & x2 & x1)`: This term is true when `x3` is low, `x2` is high, and `x1` is high, corresponding to the fourth and sixth rows of the truth table.
   - `(x3 & ~x2 & x1)`: This term is true when `x3` is high, `x2` is low, and `x1` is high, corresponding to the sixth row of the truth table.
3. The `|` operator combines these three terms to produce the final value of `f`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the given truth table.'}
