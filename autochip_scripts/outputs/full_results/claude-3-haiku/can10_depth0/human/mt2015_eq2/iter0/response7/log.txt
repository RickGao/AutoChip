The module takes two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`, and produces a 1-bit output `z`. The value of `z` is assigned using a conditional operator, which checks if `A` is equal to `B`. If they are equal, `z` is assigned the value of `1'b1` (1 bit with value 1), otherwise, `z` is assigned the value of `1'b0` (1 bit with value 0).'}
