The module you provided is correct and should function as a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The `always` block handles the two operations:

1. When `shift_ena` is 1, the module shifts in the new bit from `data` into the most significant bit of the `q` register, effectively shifting the entire register to the left by one bit.
2. When `count_ena` is 1, the module decrements the value stored in the `q` register by 1.

The module correctly handles the cases where both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are not 1 at the same time, as per the given specification.'}
