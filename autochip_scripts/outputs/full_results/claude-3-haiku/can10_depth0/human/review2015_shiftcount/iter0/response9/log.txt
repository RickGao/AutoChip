The provided Verilog module specification is complete and correct. The implementation includes the following features:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `shift_ena` for the shift enable, an input `count_ena` for the count enable, an input `data` for the data to be shifted in, and an output `q` which is a 4-bit register.
2. The `always` block responds to the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. When `shift_ena` is 1, the data is shifted into the most significant bit of the register, and the existing bits are shifted one position to the right.
4. When `count_ena` is 1, the value in the register is decremented by 1.
5. As specified, if both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1, the behavior of the module does not matter.

The provided implementation correctly fulfills the given module specification.'}
