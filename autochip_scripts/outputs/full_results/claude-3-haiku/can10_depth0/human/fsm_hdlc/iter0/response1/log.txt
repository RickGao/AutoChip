This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signals that a bit needs to be discarded (disc output is asserted).
2. `01111110`: Flags the beginning/end of a frame (flag output is asserted).
3. `01111111...`: Indicates an error (7 or more consecutive 1s) (err output is asserted).

The reset signal sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state, which behaves as though the previous input was 0. The output signals are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the corresponding condition is detected.

The `always` blocks handle the state transitions and output assignments based on the current state and input. The `next_state` variable is used to update the current state on the positive edge of the clock, and the output signals are assigned based on the current state.'}
