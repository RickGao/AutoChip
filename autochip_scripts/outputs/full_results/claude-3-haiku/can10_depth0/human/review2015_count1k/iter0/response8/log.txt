The completed Verilog module has the following features:

1. The `q` output is a 10-bit register that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive.
2. The counter has a period of 1000 cycles, meaning it counts from 0 to 999 and then resets back to 0.
3. The `reset` input is an active-high synchronous reset that sets the counter value to 0.
4. The counter increments on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
5. The conditional expression `(q == 999) ? 0 : q + 1` checks if the current value of `q` is 999. If it is, the counter is reset to 0, otherwise, it is incremented by 1.'}
