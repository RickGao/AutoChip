This module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key features are:

1. The counter is implemented using a `reg [9:0] q` to hold the 10-bit count value.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to update the counter on each positive edge of the clock.
3. The `if (reset)` block resets the counter to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
4. The `else` block increments the counter by 1 on each clock cycle, unless the counter has reached the maximum value of 999, in which case it resets the counter to 0.'}
