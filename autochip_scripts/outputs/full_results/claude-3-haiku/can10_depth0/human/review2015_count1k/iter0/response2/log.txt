The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. The counter is declared as a 10-bit register `q` to represent the range from 0 to 999.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is high.
4. When the counter reaches 999, it is reset to 0, otherwise, it is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
