The Verilog module provided correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses only 3 states.

The module correctly handles overlapping sequences, as the state machine will transition to the `DETECTED` state as soon as the "101" pattern is recognized, regardless of whether the input sequence continues after that.'}
