This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x` and asserts the output signal `z` when the sequence is detected. The FSM has three states: `STATE_INIT`, `STATE_ONE`, and `STATE_ZERO`. It also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, and the design recognizes overlapping sequences.

The `always` block for the state transition logic handles the state updates based on the current state and the input `x`. The output signal `z` is set to 1 when the FSM reaches the `STATE_ZERO` state and the input `x` is 1, indicating that the "101" sequence has been detected.'}
