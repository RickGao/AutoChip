The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses 3 states.

The module has the following components:

1. The `state` and `next_state` registers to store the current and next state of the FSM.
2. The `always` block for state updates, which updates the `state` register based on the asynchronous reset signal `aresetn` and the next state `next_state`.
3. The `always` block for next state logic, which determines the `next_state` based on the current `state` and the input `x`.
4. The `always` block for output logic, which sets the output `z` based on the current `state`.

This FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that if the input sequence is "10101", the output `z` will be asserted for the second "101" sequence.'}
