The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indication. The module has the following functionality:

1. The clock is clocked by the `clk` input signal, and the clock should increment on the positive edge of the `ena` input signal.
2. The `reset` input signal has higher priority than the `ena` signal, and when asserted, it resets the clock to "12:00 AM".
3. The `pm` output signal indicates whether the current time is PM (`pm = 1`) or AM (`pm = 0`).
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the current time in BCD format, where `hh` is the hours (01-12), `mm` is the minutes (00-59), and `ss` is the seconds (00-59).

The module uses a single always block to handle the clock logic. The reset condition is checked first, and if asserted, the clock is reset to "12:00 AM". If the `ena` signal is asserted, the module increments the seconds, minutes, and hours as necessary, wrapping around the hours from 12 to 1 when transitioning from AM to PM (or vice versa).'}
