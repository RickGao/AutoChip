The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. It has the following features:

1. The module is clocked by the `clk` input and is enabled by the `ena` input.
2. The `reset` input resets the clock to "12:00 AM" with higher priority than the `ena` input.
3. The `pm` output indicates whether the current time is AM (0) or PM (1).
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) respectively in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format.
5. The module correctly handles the roll-over of seconds, minutes, and hours, including the transition between AM and PM.'}
