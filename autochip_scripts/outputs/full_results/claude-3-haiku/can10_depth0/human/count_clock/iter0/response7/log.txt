The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator, clocked by a fast-running `clk` and incremented by a pulse on `ena`. The module has the following functionality:

1. The clock is initialized to "12:00 AM" when `reset` is asserted.
2. On each `ena` pulse, the seconds are incremented. When the seconds reach 59, the minutes are incremented, and when the minutes reach 59, the hours are incremented.
3. When the hours reach 12, the AM/PM indicator (`pm`) is toggled, and the hours are reset to 1.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs are in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, representing the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59), respectively.
5. The `reset` signal has higher priority than `ena` and can reset the clock to "12:00 AM" at any time.

The Verilog module is complete and should work as expected.'}
