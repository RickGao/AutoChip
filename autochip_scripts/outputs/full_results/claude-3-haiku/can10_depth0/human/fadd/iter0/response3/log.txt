This Verilog module implements a full adder by performing the following operations:

1. The `sum` output is calculated by taking the XOR of `a`, `b`, and `cin`. This gives the sum of the three input bits.
2. The `cout` (carry-out) output is calculated by taking the OR of two AND operations:
   - The first AND operation is between `a` and `b`, which gives the carry-out when both `a` and `b` are 1.
   - The second AND operation is between the XOR of `a` and `b`, and `cin`, which gives the carry-out when the sum of `a` and `b` is 1 and `cin` is 1.

The module uses intermediate wires (`xor1`, `and1`, `and2`) to simplify the logic and make the implementation more readable.'}
