The provided Verilog module specification describes a full adder, which adds three bits (including a carry-in) and produces a sum and a carry-out. The implementation consists of two half adders:

1. The first half adder (ha1) takes the two input bits (a and b) and produces the sum (s1) and carry (c1) for those two bits.
2. The second half adder (ha2) takes the sum (s1) from the first half adder and the carry-in (cin) and produces the final sum (sum) and carry (c2).

The carry-out (cout) is then calculated by ORing the two carry outputs (c1 and c2) from the two half adders.

The half adder module is also provided, which takes two input bits (a and b) and produces the sum (sum) and carry (cout) for those two bits.'}
