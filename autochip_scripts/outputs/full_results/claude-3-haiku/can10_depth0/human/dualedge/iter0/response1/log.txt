The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of two single-edge triggered flip-flops and a multiplexer. 

1. The first `always` block captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in the register `q_posedge`.
2. The second `always` block captures the input `d` on the negative edge of the clock and stores it in the register `q_negedge`.
3. The third `always` block acts as a multiplexer, selecting the appropriate value from `q_posedge` or `q_negedge` based on the current state of the clock signal, and assigns it to the output `q`.

This implementation effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not natively support such a construct. The output `q` will change on both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal.'}
