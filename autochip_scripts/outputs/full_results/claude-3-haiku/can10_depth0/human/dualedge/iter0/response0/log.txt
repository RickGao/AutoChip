{'assistant': 'Here is a Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two single-edge triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;

            2'b01: q = 1'b0;

            2'b11: q = q;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`q_pos`) and the other on the negative edge (`q_neg`).
2. In the final output logic, use a case statement to determine the value of `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This implementation provides the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop while using only single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are supported by FPGAs.'}
