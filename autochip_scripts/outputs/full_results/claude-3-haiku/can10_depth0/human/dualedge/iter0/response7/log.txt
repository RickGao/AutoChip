The provided module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate always blocks, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge of the clock signal. The positive edge block updates an internal register `q_reg` with the input `d`, and the negative edge block then assigns the value of `q_reg` to the output `q`.

This approach achieves the desired behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while ensuring that the code is compatible with FPGA implementations, which do not support the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
