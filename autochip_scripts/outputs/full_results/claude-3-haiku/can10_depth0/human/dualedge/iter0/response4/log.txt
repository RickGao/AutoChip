This module uses two D-type flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The outputs of the two flip-flops are then combined using a multiplexer, which selects the appropriate output based on the current state of the clock. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior, even though FPGAs do not have native support for such a construct.

The `always @(posedge clk)` and `always @(negedge clk)` blocks define the behavior of the two flip-flops, while the final `always @(*)` block implements the multiplexer logic to combine the outputs.'}
