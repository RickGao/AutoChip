This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate always blocks. The first always block captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in the internal register `d_reg`. The second always block checks for both the positive and negative edges of the clock, and updates the output `q` with the value stored in `d_reg` on both edges.'}
