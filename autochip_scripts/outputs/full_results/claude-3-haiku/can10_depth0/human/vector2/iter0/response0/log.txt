This Verilog module takes a 32-bit input vector `in` and reverses the byte order by assigning the following:

- The least significant byte (bits 7:0) of `out` is assigned the most significant byte (bits 31:24) of `in`.
- The second least significant byte (bits 15:8) of `out` is assigned the second most significant byte (bits 23:16) of `in`.
- The third least significant byte (bits 23:16) of `out` is assigned the third most significant byte (bits 15:8) of `in`.
- The most significant byte (bits 31:24) of `out` is assigned the least significant byte (bits 7:0) of `in`.

This effectively reverses the byte order of the 32-bit input vector.'}
