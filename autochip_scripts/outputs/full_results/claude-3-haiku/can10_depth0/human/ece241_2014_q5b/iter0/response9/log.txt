The Verilog code above implements the given Mealy machine specification using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has an asynchronous active-high reset, which resets the state to `A`.
2. The state is represented using a 2-bit one-hot encoding, with `A` being `01` and `B` being `10`.
3. The `next_state` logic is defined in the combinational `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The output `z` is also determined in the combinational `always @(*)` block, based on the current state and the input `x`.
5. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock, with the next state being assigned to the current state.

This implementation correctly captures the behavior of the 2's complementer Mealy machine described in the given specification.'}
