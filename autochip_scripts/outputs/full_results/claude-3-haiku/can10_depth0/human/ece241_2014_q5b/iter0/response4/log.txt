This Verilog code implements the 2's complementer using a Mealy machine with one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` for the clock, `areset` for the asynchronous active-high reset, `x` for the input, and `z` for the output.
2. The module uses two state variables, `A` and `B`, encoded in one-hot encoding.
3. The `state` register stores the current state, and the `next_state` register stores the next state.
4. The asynchronous reset sets the initial state to `A`.
5. The combinational logic in the `always @(*)` block updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `x`.
6. The output `z` is assigned based on the current state and the input `x` according to the Mealy machine specification.'}
