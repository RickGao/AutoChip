This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

This Verilog code implements the described Finite State Machine (FSM) as an arbiter circuit with three requesting devices. The code includes separate always blocks for the state flip-flops and the state table, and the output logic for the grant signals `g[i]` is defined using continuous assignment statements.

The state codes are assigned using localparam definitions, and the state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, with the active-low synchronous reset `resetn` setting the initial state to `STATE_A`.

The state table logic is implemented in the second always block, with the next state being determined based on the current state and the request signals `r[i]`. The output logic simply assigns the appropriate grant signal `g[i]` based on the current state of the FSM.

This implementation should correctly represent the described FSM and provide the desired arbiter functionality.'}
