The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the corresponding completed Verilog module is shown above. It includes the following features:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (active high synchronous reset input), and `q` (4-bit output).
2. The counter is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock.
3. Inside the always block, the counter value (`q`) is updated based on the following logic:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - If the counter value is 9 (4'd9), the counter is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.
4. The counter counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10.

This Verilog module should compile and function as a decade counter with a synchronous reset.'}
