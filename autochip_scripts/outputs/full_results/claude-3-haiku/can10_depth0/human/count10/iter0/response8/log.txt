The provided Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the module are:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`).
2. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0 (`4'b0`).
3. If the `reset` input is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. The increment operation is performed using the conditional expression `(q == 4'b1001) ? 4'b0 : q + 1`. This ensures that when the counter reaches 9 (4'b1001), it wraps around to 0.
4. The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the decade counter.

This module correctly implements the specified decade counter behavior.'}
