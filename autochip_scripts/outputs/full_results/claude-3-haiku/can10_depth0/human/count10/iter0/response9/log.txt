The provided Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The counter is reset to 0 when the reset input is active high and synchronous.

The module uses a single always block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside the block, the counter value `q` is updated based on the following logic:

1. If the reset input is high, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0000`).
2. If the reset input is low, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1`), unless the counter has reached its maximum value of 9 (`q == 4'b1001`), in which case it is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0000`).

This implementation ensures that the counter increments from 0 to 9, and then resets back to 0, repeating the cycle indefinitely.'}
