The provided Verilog code is correct and should implement a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous, and it resets the counter to 0.

The key elements of the implementation are:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`).
2. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0000`).
3. If the counter has reached the value 9 (`q == 4'b1001`), it is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0000`).
4. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1'b1`).

This implementation should meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.'}
