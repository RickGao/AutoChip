The provided Verilog module code is correct and should implement a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses a single `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside the block, the module checks if the reset input is high, and if so, sets the output `q` to 0. If the reset is not active, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 9, and if so, resets `q` to 0. Otherwise, it increments the value of `q` by 1.'}
