```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` outputs were not initialized to 0 when the conditions were not met. This could lead to latches being inferred. The fix is to explicitly set the outputs to 0 when the conditions are not met.

2. The `keep_driving` logic was inverted. It should be set to `~gas_tank_empty` when `~arrived`, not the other way around.

The corrected code addresses these issues and should work as expected.'}
