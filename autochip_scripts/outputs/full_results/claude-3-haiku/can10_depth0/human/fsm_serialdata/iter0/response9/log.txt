{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM consists of the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state, waiting for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: The start bit has been detected, so the FSM starts receiving the 8 data bits.
3. `DATA`: The FSM is receiving the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `shift_reg` register.
4. `STOP`: The 8 data bits have been received, and the FSM is waiting for the stop bit (1) to be detected.
5. `WAIT_STOP`: If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM waits until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module includes the following functionality:

- Synchronous reset: When the `reset` input is high, the FSM is reset to the `IDLE` state, and the `out_byte` and `done` outputs are cleared.
- Data reception: The FSM detects the start bit, receives the 8 data bits, and verifies the stop bit. The received data byte is stored in the `shift_reg` register.
- Output generation: When the stop bit is correctly detected, the `done` output is asserted, and the `out_byte` output is set to the value of the `shift_reg` register.
- Error handling: If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM enters the `WAIT_STOP` state and waits until a stop bit is found before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module assumes that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, which is handled by the shifting operation in the `DATA` state.'}
