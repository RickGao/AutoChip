{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine to identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. It handles the following states:

1. **IDLE**: This is the initial state where the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. **START_BIT**: Once the start bit is detected, the module moves to this state to verify that the start bit is valid (0).
3. **DATA_BITS**: In this state, the module reads the 8 data bits and stores them in the `data_register`.
4. **STOP_BIT**: After the data bits have been read, the module moves to this state to verify that the stop bit (1) is present.
5. **ERROR**: If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the module moves to this state and waits until a valid stop bit (1) is detected before returning to the IDLE state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset, which resets the state machine and clears the output registers.

The `out_byte` output is valid when the `done` signal is asserted, indicating that a complete byte has been successfully received. The `done` signal is asserted each time a stop bit is detected.'}
