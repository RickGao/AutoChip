{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has four states: `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_START`, `STATE_DATA`, and `STATE_STOP`.
2. In the `STATE_IDLE` state, the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. In the `STATE_START` state, the module checks the start bit and then proceeds to read the 8 data bits, one by one, into the `data_buffer` register.
4. Once all 8 data bits have been read, the module checks the stop bit (1). If the stop bit is valid, the module transitions to the `STATE_STOP` state. If the stop bit is not valid, the module stays in the `STATE_START` state until a valid stop bit is detected.
5. In the `STATE_STOP` state, the module sets the `done` output to 1 and the `out_byte` output to the value in the `data_buffer` register, then transitions back to the `STATE_IDLE` state.
6. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which sets the module back to the `STATE_IDLE` state and clears the internal registers.'}
