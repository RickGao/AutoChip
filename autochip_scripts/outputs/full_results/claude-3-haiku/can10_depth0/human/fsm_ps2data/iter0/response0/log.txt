{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

The provided Verilog module implements the desired finite state machine for searching and receiving 3-byte messages in an input byte stream. The module has the following functionality:

1. The `state` register keeps track of the current state of the FSM, which can be one of the following:
   - `0`: Searching for the start of a message (when `in[3]` is 1)
   - `1`: Receiving the second byte of the message
   - `2`: Receiving the third byte of the message
   - `3`: Signaling the completion of a message

2. The `count` register keeps track of the number of bytes received so far in the current message (0, 1, 2, or 3).

3. The `message` register stores the 24-bit message as it is being received.

4. The `always` block handles the state transitions and message reception:
   - If `reset` is high, the module resets the state, count, and message.
   - Otherwise, the module transitions through the states based on the current state and the value of `in[3]`.
   - When the third byte of the message is received (state 2), the module transitions to state 3, where it signals the completion of the message by asserting the `done` output.

5. The `out_bytes` output is assigned the value of the `message` register, which contains the completed 24-bit message whenever the `done` signal is asserted.

This implementation matches the provided waveform example and should correctly process the input byte stream to detect and output the 3-byte messages as described.'}
