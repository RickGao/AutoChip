The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog code implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specifications. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the start sequence (1101) to be detected.
2. `DETECT_START`: In this state, the module detects the start sequence (1101) and then transitions to the next state.
3. `SHIFT_DURATION`: After detecting the start sequence, the module shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration of the timer. It asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles to enable this.
4. `WAIT_DONE`: In this state, the module waits for the counters to finish counting, as indicated by the `done_counting` input being high.
5. `NOTIFY_DONE`: Once the counters have finished, the module asserts the `done` output to notify the user, and waits for the user to acknowledge this by setting the `ack` input high.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` input is high.'}
