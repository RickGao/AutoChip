This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer functionality as described in the problem statement. The module has the following key features:

1. It has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `SEARCH` where it begins looking for the input sequence `1101`.
2. When the `1101` sequence is detected, the state machine transitions to the `SHIFT` state, where it asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration value.
3. After the duration value is shifted in, the state machine transitions to the `COUNT` state, where it asserts the `counting` signal and waits for the `done_counting` input to indicate that the counters have finished.
4. Once the counting is done, the state machine transitions to the `DONE` state, where it asserts the `done` signal to notify the user that the timer has timed out. It then waits for the `ack` signal before resetting back to the `SEARCH` state.

The state transitions and output signals are all handled within the `always @*` block, which implements the combinational logic of the state machine. The current state is updated in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, which implements the sequential logic of the state machine.'}
