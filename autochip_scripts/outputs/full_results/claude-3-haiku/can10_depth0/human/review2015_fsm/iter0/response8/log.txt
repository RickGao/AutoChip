The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The key points in this implementation are:

1. The use of a state machine with four states: `WAIT_FOR_START`, `SHIFT_DATA`, `WAIT_DONE`, and `NOTIFY_USER`.
2. The `bit_count` register to keep track of the number of bits shifted in, to determine when the 4-bit duration value has been shifted in.
3. The conditional logic in the state transition to handle the various conditions, such as detecting the start sequence, waiting for the counters to finish, and waiting for the user acknowledgment.
4. The output assignments to control the `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` signals based on the current state.

This implementation should correctly implement the desired timer state machine functionality.'}
