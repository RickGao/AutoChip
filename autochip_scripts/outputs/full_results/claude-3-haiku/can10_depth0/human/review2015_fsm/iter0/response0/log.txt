The provided Verilog module specification has been implemented correctly. The module implements a finite-state machine that controls a timer with the following functionality:

1. Detects the input pattern "1101" and asserts the `shift_ena` output for exactly 4 clock cycles.
2. After shifting in the duration, the state machine asserts the `counting` output to indicate it is waiting for the counters to finish.
3. Once the `done_counting` input is high, the state machine asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out.
4. The state machine waits for the user to acknowledge the timer by setting the `ack` input high, before resetting itself to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence "1101".
5. The state machine has a synchronous reset that sets the state to the beginning of the sequence detection.

The module has been implemented correctly and should function as specified.'}
