After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The key changes made:
1. Added the state transition logic to handle the different states of the state machine: waiting for start sequence, shifting in 4 bits, counting, and waiting for user acknowledgment.
2. Implemented the shift_ena, counting, and done outputs based on the current state.
3. Maintained a bit_count variable to keep track of the number of bits shifted in.
4. Added the synchronous reset logic to reset the state machine to the initial state.

The state machine should now correctly handle the given timer functionality.'}
