The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The module has the following features:

1. Asynchronous positive edge triggered `areset` that resets the shift register to zero.
2. Synchronous active high `load` signal that loads the shift register with `data[3:0]`.
3. Synchronous active high `ena` signal that shifts the contents of the shift register right by one bit, with the MSB (`q[3]`) becoming zero and the LSB (`q[0]`) being shifted out.
4. The `load` input has higher priority than the `ena` input, so if both are asserted, the shift register will be loaded with `data[3:0]`.
5. The output `q[3:0]` contains the current contents of the shift register.

The module uses a single `always` block that handles all the logic, including the asynchronous reset, the load operation, and the shift operation. This ensures that the module behaves correctly according to the given specification.'}
