The provided Verilog module specification is correct and the above implementation should work as expected. The key points are:

1. Use a single `always` block to handle the counter logic.
2. Check for reset condition and set the counter to 0 if reset is active.
3. If reset is not active, increment the counter until it reaches the maximum value of 15 (4'b1111), then wrap around to 0.
4. Use the ternary operator `?:` to handle the wrap-around logic concisely.

This implementation will create a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 (inclusive) with a period of 16, and resets to 0 when the reset input is active high.'}
