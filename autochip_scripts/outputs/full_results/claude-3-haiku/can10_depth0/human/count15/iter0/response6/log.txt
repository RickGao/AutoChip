The provided Verilog code for a 4-bit binary counter is correct and should work as expected. The module takes two inputs: `clk` and `reset`, and produces a 4-bit output `q` that counts from 0 to 15 (inclusive) with a period of 16.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` input. Inside the block, the code checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0`). If the `reset` input is low, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1'b1`). The conditional expression `(q == 4'b1111) ? 4'b0 : q + 1'b1` ensures that when the counter reaches 15 (4'b1111), it wraps around to 0 on the next clock cycle.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified 4-bit binary counter behavior.'}
