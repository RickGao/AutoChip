The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 (inclusive) with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

Here's how the module works:

1. The `q` register is declared as a 4-bit wide register to hold the current count value.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0`).
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the module checks if the current count value `q` is equal to 15 (the maximum count value). If it is, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0`); otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1`).

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 15, inclusive, with a period of 16, and the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` input is active high.'}
