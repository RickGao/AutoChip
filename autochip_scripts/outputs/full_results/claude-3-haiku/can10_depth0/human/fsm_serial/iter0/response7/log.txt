{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits.

Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset.

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communications protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.
2. In the IDLE state, the module waits for the start bit (logic 0) to be detected.
3. Once the start bit is detected, the module transitions to the START state.
4. In the START state, the module waits for the start bit to become logic 1, indicating the start of the data bits.
5. When the start bit becomes logic 1, the module transitions to the DATA state.
6. In the DATA state, the module reads the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
7. After all 8 data bits have been read, the module transitions to the STOP state.
8. In the STOP state, the module checks that the stop bit is logic 1. If it is, the `done` output is set to 1, indicating that the byte has been successfully received.
9. If the stop bit is not logic 1 when expected, the module stays in the STOP state until a stop bit is detected, and then transitions back to the IDLE state.
10. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and the internal registers when the `reset` input is high.

This implementation should correctly identify and receive bytes in the specified serial communications protocol.'}
