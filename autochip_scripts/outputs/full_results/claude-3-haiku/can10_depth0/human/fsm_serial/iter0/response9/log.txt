{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state, waiting for the detection of a start bit.
2. **START_BIT**: Verifies the validity of the start bit.
3. **DATA_BITS**: Shifts in the 8 data bits.
4. **STOP_BIT**: Verifies the presence of the stop bit.

The module uses internal registers to keep track of the current state, the bit count, and the received data. When a valid byte is received (start bit, 8 data bits, and stop bit), the `done` output is set to 1. The FSM also handles the case where the stop bit is not valid, waiting for the next start bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset, which resets the FSM to the IDLE state and clears the internal registers.'}
