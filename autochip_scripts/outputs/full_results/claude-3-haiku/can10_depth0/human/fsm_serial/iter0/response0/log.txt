{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module above implements the finite state machine (FSM) to identify when bytes have been correctly received from a serial communications protocol. The FSM has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The FSM is waiting for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: The FSM has detected the start bit and is now receiving the 8 data bits.
3. `DATA`: The FSM is receiving the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP`: The FSM is waiting for the stop bit (1) to be detected.
5. `ERROR`: The FSM has detected an error, and is waiting for the stop bit (1) to be detected before returning to the `IDLE` state.

The FSM keeps track of the current state, the number of bits received (`bit_count`), and the received data bits (`data_reg`). When the stop bit is correctly detected, the `done` output is set high to indicate that a complete byte has been received.

If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM enters the `ERROR` state and waits for the stop bit to be detected before returning to the `IDLE` state and waiting for the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the FSM is reset to the `IDLE` state, the `bit_count` and `data_reg` are cleared, and the `done` output is set low.'}
