{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received from a stream of bits. The FSM has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state, where the FSM waits for the start bit (0).
2. `START`: The state where the FSM verifies the start bit.
3. `DATA`: The state where the FSM reads the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP`: The state where the FSM verifies the stop bit (1).
5. `ERROR`: The state where the FSM handles a stop bit error.

The FSM uses the following registers:

- `state`: The current state of the FSM.
- `bit_count`: The count of the number of data bits received.
- `data_reg`: The 8-bit register that stores the received data.
- `done`: The output signal that is set high when a byte has been correctly received.

The FSM operates as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, the FSM waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. Once the start bit is detected, the FSM transitions to the `START` state to verify the start bit.
3. If the start bit is confirmed, the FSM transitions to the `DATA` state, where it reads the 8 data bits one by one.
4. After the 8 data bits have been read, the FSM transitions to the `STOP` state to verify the stop bit (1).
5. If the stop bit is correct, the `done` signal is set high, and the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state.
6. If the stop bit is not correct, the FSM transitions to the `ERROR` state, where it waits for the next stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The FSM also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the `reset` input can be used to reset the module to its initial state.'}
