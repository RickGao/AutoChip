The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Added a `reg [9:0] count` to store the internal counter value.
2. In the `always` block:
   - If `load` is 1, the `count` is loaded with the `data` value, and the `tc` output is cleared.
   - If `load` is 0:
     - If `count` is greater than 0, it is decremented by 1, and the `tc` output is kept at 0.
     - If `count` reaches 0, the `tc` output is asserted (set to 1).

This implementation ensures that the timer behaves as per the given specifications.'}
