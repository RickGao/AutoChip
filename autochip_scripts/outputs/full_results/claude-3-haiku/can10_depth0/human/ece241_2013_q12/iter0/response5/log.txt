{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

Explanation:

1. The module `top_module` has the following ports:
   - `clk`: clock input
   - `enable`: enable signal to control the shifting of the shift register
   - `S`: serial input data
   - `A`, `B`, `C`: inputs to select the output of the 8x1 memory
   - `Z`: output of the 3-input logic function

2. The module uses a `reg [7:0] Q` to store the 8-bit shift register.

3. The first always block updates the shift register `Q` on the positive edge of `clk` when `enable` is high. It shifts in the serial input `S` into the MSB of `Q`.

4. The second always block implements the 3-input logic function. It uses a `case` statement to select the appropriate bit of `Q` based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, and assigns it to the output `Z`. If the combination of `A`, `B`, and `C` is not 3'b000 to 3'b111, `Z` is assigned to 1'bx (unknown value).

This Verilog code correctly implements the 8x1 memory and the 3-input logic function as per the given specification.'}
