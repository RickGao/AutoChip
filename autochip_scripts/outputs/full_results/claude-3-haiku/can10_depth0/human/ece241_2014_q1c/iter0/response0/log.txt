The provided Verilog module implements the desired functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has four ports: `a` and `b` are the two 8-bit 2's complement input numbers, `s` is the 8-bit output sum, and `overflow` is the output flag indicating whether a signed overflow has occurred.

2. An internal 9-bit wire `sum` is used to store the result of the addition. The addition is performed by concatenating the sign bit (`a[7]` and `b[7]`) with the respective 8-bit numbers, effectively performing a 9-bit signed addition.

3. The output `s` is assigned the lower 8 bits of the `sum` wire, which represents the final sum.

4. The `overflow` output is assigned based on the condition that the sign bits of the input operands `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign bit of the result `sum[7]` is different. This indicates that a signed overflow has occurred.

This Verilog module correctly implements the given specification and handles the signed overflow condition.'}
