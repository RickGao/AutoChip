The completed Verilog module performs the following operations:

1. It declares a wire `sum` of 9-bit width to hold the result of the addition.
2. The addition is performed by concatenating the sign bit (`a[7]` and `b[7]`) with the 8-bit input values (`a` and `b`) and then adding them together.
3. The 8-bit sum is assigned to the output `s`.
4. The overflow condition is detected by checking if the sign bits of the input operands `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign bit of the sum `sum[7]` is different. This indicates that an overflow has occurred.
5. The overflow flag is assigned to the output `overflow`.

This module correctly performs the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects overflow.'}
