{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want to create a timer with one input that:\n\n// (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input until it resumes searching after everything else is done.\n\n// The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. \n\n// When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).\n\n// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous. \n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput wire clk,\n\tinput wire reset,\n\tinput wire data,\n    output wire [3:0] count,\n    output reg counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input wire ack );"}

This Verilog module implements the desired timer functionality as per the given specification. It has the following key features:

1. The module starts in the `IDLE` state, where it continuously shifts in the incoming serial data into the `shift_reg` register.
2. When the 4-bit pattern `1101` is detected in the `shift_reg`, the module transitions to the `CAPTURE_DELAY` state.
3. In the `CAPTURE_DELAY` state, the next 4 bits of the serial data are captured into the `delay` register, and the module then transitions to the `COUNT_DOWN` state.
4. In the `COUNT_DOWN` state, the module asserts the `counting` output and starts a counter (`timer_count`) that counts up to the value of `delay`. The current remaining time is calculated and output on the `count` port.
5. Once the counter reaches the `delay` value, the module transitions to the `NOTIFY_DONE` state, where it asserts the `done` output and waits for the `ack` input to be asserted.
6. When `ack` is asserted, the module resets and goes back to the `IDLE` state, ready to detect the next start sequence.
7. The module also has a synchronous reset functionality, where the `reset` input can be used to reset the module to the `IDLE` state.

This implementation should meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.'}
