This Verilog module implements a JK flip-flop based on the given truth table. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` input, and the behavior of the flip-flop is defined using a `case` statement based on the values of `j` and `k`.

The `case` statement covers the following conditions:

- `2'b00`: When `j` and `k` are both 0, the output `Q` remains the same as the previous value (`Qold`).
- `2'b01`: When `j` is 0 and `k` is 1, the output `Q` is set to 0.
- `2'b10`: When `j` is 1 and `k` is 0, the output `Q` is set to 1.
- `2'b11`: When `j` and `k` are both 1, the output `Q` is set to the complement of the previous value (`~Q`).

The `output reg Q` declaration ensures that the output `Q` is a registered output.'}
