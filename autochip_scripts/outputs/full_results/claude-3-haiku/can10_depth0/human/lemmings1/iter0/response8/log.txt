{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Moore state machine to model the behavior of Lemmings. The module has two states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming walking left or right, respectively. The state is updated based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs, and the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set accordingly.

The module also includes an asynchronous reset mechanism, where the `areset` input resets the state to `LEFT` and sets the `walk_left` output to 1 and the `walk_right` output to 0.'}
