{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module implements a Moore state machine to model the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has two states: `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming's walking direction. The module takes in four inputs: `clk`, `areset`, `bump_left`, and `bump_right`, and produces two outputs: `walk_left` and `walk_right`.

The `always` block for the current state updates the state on the positive edge of the clock or when the `areset` signal is high. The `always` block for the next state uses a case statement to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of `bump_left` and `bump_right`.

In the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state, the module sets `walk_left` to 1 and `walk_right` to 0. If `bump_left` or `bump_right` is high, the module transitions to the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state. Otherwise, it remains in the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state.

In the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state, the module sets `walk_left` to 0 and `walk_right` to 1. If `bump_left` or `bump_right` is high, the module transitions to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state. Otherwise, it remains in the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state.

The default case is used to handle any unexpected states, where both `walk_left` and `walk_right` are set to 0 and the next state is set to `STATE_WALK_LEFT`.'}
