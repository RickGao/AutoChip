{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. The module has two states, `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming's direction of movement. The state transitions are based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs, which indicate whether the Lemming has encountered an obstacle on the left or right side, respectively.

The combinational logic in the `always @(*)` block determines the next state based on the current state and the input conditions. The sequential logic in the `always @(posedge clk, posedge areset)` block updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is active.

The output logic in the final `always @(*)` block sets the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs based on the current state of the Lemming.'}
