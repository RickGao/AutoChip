{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state.

The provided Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `load` (load signal), and `data` (initial state data).
2. The module has one output: `q`, which represents the current state of the 16x16 grid.
3. The module uses a `next_state` register to store the next state of the grid, which is calculated based on the current state (`q`) and the rules of the Game of Life.
4. The `always` block on the clock signal updates the `q` register. If `load` is high, the `data` input is loaded into `q`. Otherwise, the `next_state` is assigned to `q`.
5. The second `always` block calculates the next state of the grid by iterating over all 256 cells and applying the rules of the Game of Life:
   - The number of neighbors for each cell is calculated by checking the neighboring cells.
   - The next state of each cell is determined based on the number of neighbors and the current state of the cell.
   - The `next_state` register is updated with the new state.

This implementation correctly handles the toroidal nature of the grid by wrapping around the edges, and it updates the game state on every clock cycle.'}
