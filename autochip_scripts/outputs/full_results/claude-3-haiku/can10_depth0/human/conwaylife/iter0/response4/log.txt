{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state. Active high synchronous.\n// (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.\n// The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [255:0] data,\n\toutput reg [255:0] q);'}

The key changes made to the provided Verilog code are:

1. Added a function `next_state` that takes the current state of the 16x16 grid (`current_state`) and computes the next state based on the Game of Life rules.
2. In the `always` block, the current state `q` is updated based on whether the `load` input is active or not. If `load` is active, `q` is assigned the input `data`. Otherwise, `q` is assigned the result of the `next_state` function.
3. The `next_state` function iterates through each row of the grid, computes the number of neighbors for each cell, and updates the cell state based on the Game of Life rules.
4. The toroidal behavior is implemented by checking the neighbors across the grid edges, effectively wrapping the grid around.

This corrected Verilog module should now correctly implement the Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
