{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state.

The Verilog module provided here implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module has the following features:

1. It takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and an initial state `data` (a 256-bit vector representing the 16x16 grid).
2. It updates the game state `q` (a 256-bit vector) every clock cycle according to the rules of the Game of Life.
3. The game state is updated based on the number of live neighbors for each cell, taking into account the toroidal nature of the grid.
4. If the `load` signal is active, the module loads the `data` vector into the current state `q` on the next clock edge.
5. Otherwise, the module updates the current state `q` to the next state `next_state` on the next clock edge.

This module should correctly implement the Game of Life cellular automaton on the given 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
