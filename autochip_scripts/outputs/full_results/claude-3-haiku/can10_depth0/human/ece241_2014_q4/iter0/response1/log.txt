This Verilog module implements the given finite state machine circuit. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module declares three D flip-flops `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` to store the intermediate states.
2. The three gates (XOR, AND, and OR) are implemented using Verilog expressions: `x_xor`, `x_and`, and `x_or`.
3. The `always` block at the positive edge of the `clk` signal updates the D inputs of the flip-flops with the corresponding gate outputs.
4. The final output `z` is assigned the negated XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs.

The module is complete and should compile without any issues.'}
