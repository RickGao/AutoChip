The provided Verilog module implements the given finite state machine circuit. 

The key components are:

1. Three D flip-flops to store the current state of the machine.
2. Combinational logic to compute the next state based on the current input `x` and the current state stored in the flip-flops.
3. An XNOR gate to compute the final output `z` based on the outputs of the three flip-flops.

The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop implementation that updates the `q` and `q_n` outputs on the positive edge of the clock signal.'}
