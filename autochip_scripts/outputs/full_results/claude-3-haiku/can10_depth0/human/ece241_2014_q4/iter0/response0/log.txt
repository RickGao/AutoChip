The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. The key points are:

1. Three D flip-flops, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`, are used to store the state of the circuit.
2. The inputs to each flip-flop are calculated based on the input `x` and the current state of the corresponding flip-flop.
   - `q1` is updated by XORing `x` with the current value of `q1`.
   - `q2` is updated by ANDing `x` with the complement of the current value of `q2`.
   - `q3` is updated by ORing `x` with the complement of the current value of `q3`.
3. The output `z` is calculated by taking the XNOR of the three intermediate signals `x_xor_q1`, `x_and_q1_bar`, and `x_or_q1_bar`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
