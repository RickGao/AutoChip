The provided Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It declares the three D flip-flops `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`, and then uses combinational logic to generate the `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out` signals based on the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs.

The three-input XNOR gate is then used to compute the final output `z` based on these three intermediate signals.

The sequential logic section updates the state of the three flip-flops on the positive edge of the clock signal.'}
