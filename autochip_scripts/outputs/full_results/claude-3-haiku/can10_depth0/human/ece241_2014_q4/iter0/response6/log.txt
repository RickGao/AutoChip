The Verilog code above implements the given finite state machine circuit. The key points are:

1. Three D flip-flops (d1, d2, d3) are used to store the state of the machine.
2. The input `x` is connected to the D inputs of the flip-flops through XOR, AND, and OR gates as described in the problem statement.
3. The complemented outputs of the flip-flops (nq1, nq2, nq3) are used as the second inputs to the AND and OR gates.
4. Finally, the outputs of the three flip-flops are connected to a 3-input XNOR gate to produce the final output `z`.
5. The `dff` module encapsulates the D flip-flop logic, updating the `q` and `nq` outputs on the positive edge of the clock.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
