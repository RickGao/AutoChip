The Verilog module provided implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`.
2. The module starts in the `STATE_A` upon reset.
3. In `STATE_A`, the module remains in this state as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to `STATE_B`.
4. In `STATE_B`, the module counts the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 using the `count` register. If the count reaches 2 (exactly two `w` signals were 1 in the last 3 cycles), the module transitions to `STATE_C`. Otherwise, it transitions back to `STATE_A` and sets the output `z` to 0.
5. In `STATE_C`, the module sets the output `z` to 1 and then transitions back to `STATE_A`.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to implement the given finite state machine.'}
