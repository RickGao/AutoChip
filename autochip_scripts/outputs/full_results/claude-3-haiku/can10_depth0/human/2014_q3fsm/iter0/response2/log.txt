The Verilog code provided implements the finite state machine (FSM) as described in the problem statement. The FSM has four states: A, B, C, and D.

The FSM starts in the reset state A. If the input `s` is 1, the FSM transitions to state B and starts counting the number of times `w` is 1 over the next three clock cycles using the `count` register.

If `w` is 1 in exactly two of the next three clock cycles, the FSM transitions to state C and sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. If `w` is not 1 in exactly two of the next three clock cycles, the FSM transitions to state D and sets the output `z` to 0 in the following clock cycle.

The FSM then continues checking the input `w` for the next three clock cycles, and the process repeats.'}
