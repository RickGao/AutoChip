{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects are:

1. The `q` register stores the current state of the 512-cell system.
2. On the `load` signal, the state is updated with the `data` input.
3. On each clock cycle without `load`, the next state of each cell is computed based on the XOR of its two neighbors, with the boundary cells assumed to be 0.
4. The `for` loop iterates over all 512 cells and updates the `q` register with the next state.

The module should correctly implement the Rule 90 cellular automaton and advance the state by one time step on each clock cycle.'}
