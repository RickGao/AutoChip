{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle.

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` to advance the simulation by one time step per clock cycle.
2. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the 512-cell system from the `data` input.
3. The `q` output is a 512-bit vector that holds the current state of the cellular automaton.
4. In the `always` block, on each clock cycle:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the state is updated according to the Rule 90 logic:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of `q[1]` (the second cell).
     - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0 (the boundary condition).
     - For all other cells `q[i]`, the new value is the XOR of the left and right neighbors `q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton as specified in the problem statement.'}
