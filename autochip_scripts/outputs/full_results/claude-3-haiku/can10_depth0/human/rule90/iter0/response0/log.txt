{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has a 512-bit output register `q` to store the state of the cellular automaton.
2. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the system from the `data` input.
3. On each clock cycle, if `load` is not active, the next state of the cellular automaton is computed by XORing the current state of each cell with its two neighbors. 
4. The boundary conditions are handled by setting `q[0]` to the value of `q[1]` (left neighbor of the first cell) and `q[511]` to 0 (right neighbor of the last cell).
5. The loop using the `genvar` construct iterates over the internal cells (1 to 510) and computes the next state based on the Rule 90 formula.'}
