The provided Verilog code implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that searches for the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream. When the sequence is found, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains set until the `reset` input is asserted.

The FSM has four states:

1. `S0`: Waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.
2. `S1`: Waiting for the second '1' in the sequence.
3. `S2`: Waiting for the '0' in the sequence.
4. `S3`: Waiting for the final '1' in the sequence.

The `next_state` logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the state based on the current state and the input `data`. When the complete sequence "1101" is detected, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains set until the `reset` input is asserted.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block handles the synchronous update of the state and the `start_shifting` output based on the `next_state` logic and the `reset` input.'}
