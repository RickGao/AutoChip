The Verilog module provided implements the state machine described in the problem statement. The inputs to the module are the current state `y[5:0]` and the input `w`. The outputs are the next state inputs `Y1` and `Y3`, which correspond to the inputs of the state flip-flops `y[1]` and `y[3]`, respectively.

The logic for `Y1` is derived as follows:
- When the current state is `A` (represented by `y[0]`) and `w` is 0, the next state is `A`, so `Y1 = 0`.
- When the current state is `B` (represented by `y[1]`) and `w` is 1, the next state is `C`, so `Y1 = 1`.
- When the current state is `F` (represented by `y[5]`) and `w` is 1, the next state is `C`, so `Y1 = 1`.
- All other current states should have `Y1 = 0`.

The logic for `Y3` is derived similarly:
- When the current state is `B` (represented by `y[1]`) and `w` is 0, the next state is `D`, so `Y3 = 0`.
- When the current state is `C` (represented by `y[2]`) and `w` is 1, the next state is `E`, so `Y3 = 1`.
- When the current state is `D` (represented by `y[3]`) and `w` is 0, the next state is `A`, so `Y3 = 0`.
- All other current states should have `Y3 = 0`.'}
