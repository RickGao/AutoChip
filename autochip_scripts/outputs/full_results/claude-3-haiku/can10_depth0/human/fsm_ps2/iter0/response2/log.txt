{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) that detects the boundaries of the PS/2 mouse protocol messages within a continuous byte stream. Here's how the module works:

1. The module has four states: `WAIT_START`, `RECV_BYTE1`, `RECV_BYTE2`, and `RECV_BYTE3`.
2. The module starts in the `WAIT_START` state, where it discards bytes until it sees one with `in[3]` set to 1. This indicates the start of a new message.
3. When a byte with `in[3]` set to 1 is detected, the module transitions to the `RECV_BYTE1` state and stores the byte in the `byte1` register.
4. The module then transitions to the `RECV_BYTE2` state and stores the next byte in the `byte2` register.
5. The module then transitions to the `RECV_BYTE3` state and stores the final byte in the `byte3` register.
6. In the `RECV_BYTE3` state, the module sets the `done` output to 1, indicating that a complete message has been received.
7. The module then transitions back to the `WAIT_START` state, waiting for the next message to start.
8. The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the module to the `WAIT_START` state.

The provided Verilog module should correctly detect and signal the boundaries of the PS/2 mouse protocol messages.'}
