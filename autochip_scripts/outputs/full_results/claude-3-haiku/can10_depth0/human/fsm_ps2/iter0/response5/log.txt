{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This module implements the finite state machine described in the problem specification. The key points are:

1. The module has four states: `S_WAIT`, `S_RECV1`, `S_RECV2`, and `S_RECV3`.
2. In the `S_WAIT` state, the module waits for the first byte of a message (i.e., `in[3] == 1`).
3. Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to `S_RECV1`, `S_RECV2`, and `S_RECV3` to receive the remaining two bytes of the message.
4. After the third byte is received, the module sets the `done` output to `1` in the next cycle, and then returns to the `S_WAIT` state.
5. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `S_WAIT` and the `done` output to `0`.'}
