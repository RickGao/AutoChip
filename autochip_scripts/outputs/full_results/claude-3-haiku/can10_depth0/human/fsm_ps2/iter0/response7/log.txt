{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that detects the start and end of PS/2 mouse protocol messages. The FSM has four states:

1. `STATE_WAIT`: The initial state where the FSM waits for the first byte of a message (with in[3] = 1).
2. `STATE_BYTE1`: The state where the first byte of the message has been detected.
3. `STATE_BYTE2`: The state where the second byte of the message has been detected.
4. `STATE_BYTE3`: The state where the third byte of the message has been detected. In this state, the `done` output is asserted to indicate that a complete message has been received.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the value of `in[3]`. When `in[3]` is 1, the FSM moves to the next state. When `in[3]` is 0, the FSM remains in the `STATE_WAIT` state, waiting for the next message.

The `reset` signal is used to synchronously reset the FSM to the `STATE_WAIT` state and clear the `done` output.'}
