The provided Verilog module specification is for a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The module has a synchronous active-high reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The completed Verilog module consists of the following:

1. The `top_module` declaration with the input ports `clk`, `reset`, and the output port `q`.
2. A register `next_q` to store the next state of the LFSR.
3. An `always` block that updates the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock. If `reset` is high, the output is set to `5'b10000` (the initial state). Otherwise, the output is updated with the next state from `next_q`.
4. An `always` block that computes the next state `next_q` based on the current state `q`. The logic for the next state is implemented according to the Galois LFSR structure, with the taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

This completed Verilog module should correctly implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with the specified tap positions and the synchronous active-high reset.'}
