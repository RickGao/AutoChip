The provided Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximum-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, as specified in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. It has a `clk` input for the clock signal and a `reset` input for the active-high synchronous reset.
2. The `q` output is a 5-bit register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
3. The `next_q` register is used to compute the next state of the LFSR.
4. The first always block updates the `q` register based on the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, the LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001`. Otherwise, the current state `q` is updated with the next state `next_q`.
5. The second always block computes the next state `next_q` based on the current state `q`. The XOR of bits 0 and 2 (tap positions 5 and 3) is assigned to bit 4 of `next_q`, and the remaining bits are shifted one position to the right.

This implementation ensures that the LFSR cycles through all possible states (except the all-zero state) before repeating, as required for a maximum-length LFSR.'}
