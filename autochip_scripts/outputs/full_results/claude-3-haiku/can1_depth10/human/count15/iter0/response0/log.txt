The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (synchronous reset input), and `q` (4-bit output).
2. The module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the value of the `reset` input:
   - If `reset` is high, the counter value `q` is reset to `4'b0000`.
   - If `reset` is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1, wrapping around to `4'b0000` when it reaches `4'b1111`.

This implementation fulfills the given specification of a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16, and a synchronous reset that sets the counter to 0.'}
