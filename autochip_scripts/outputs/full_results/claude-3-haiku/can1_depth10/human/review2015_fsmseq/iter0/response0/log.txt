The Verilog module correctly implements the finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream and sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 when the sequence is found, until the `reset` signal is asserted.

The module defines three states: `IDLE`, `SEARCH`, and `FOUND`. In the `IDLE` state, the module checks if the shift register contains the sequence 1101, and if so, transitions to the `FOUND` state. In the `SEARCH` state, the module continues to check for the sequence 1101. Once the sequence is found, the module transitions to the `FOUND` state and sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, which remains set until the `reset` signal is asserted.

The module also includes the necessary synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and clears the `start_shifting` output when the `reset` signal is asserted.'}
