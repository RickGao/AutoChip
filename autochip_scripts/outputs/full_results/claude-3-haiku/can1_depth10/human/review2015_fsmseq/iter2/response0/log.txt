The issue with the original code was that the `start_shifting` output was not being set correctly. In the `FOUND` state, the `start_shifting` output should be set to 1 and remain 1 until the `reset` signal is asserted.

In the updated code, the `start_shifting` output is now being set to 1 in the `FOUND` state and remains 1 until the `reset` signal is asserted, which resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state.'}
