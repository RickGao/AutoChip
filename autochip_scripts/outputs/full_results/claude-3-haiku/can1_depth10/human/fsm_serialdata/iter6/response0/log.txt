{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

```

The main change is in the STOP state. Previously, the module would stay in the STOP state until it encountered a stop bit (logic high). This would cause issues if the data stream had an extra stop bit or the stop bit was missed.

In the corrected version, the module transitions to the IDLE state as soon as it detects the stop bit, and then asserts the `done` signal. This ensures that the `out_byte` output is valid when `done` is high, and the module is ready to receive the next byte.

Additionally, the module now correctly resets the `bit_count` to 0 in the STOP state, ensuring that the next byte is received correctly.'}
