{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine that can correctly identify and receive bytes from a serial data stream. The module has the following key features:

1. It defines four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP to handle the different stages of byte reception.
2. In the IDLE state, it waits for the start bit (0) to arrive.
3. In the START state, it verifies the start bit and then transitions to the DATA state.
4. In the DATA state, it samples the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
5. In the STOP state, it verifies the stop bit (1) and, if correct, outputs the received byte in `out_byte` and asserts the `done` signal.
6. If the stop bit is not received as expected, the FSM will remain in the IDLE state until a valid stop bit is detected, before attempting to receive the next byte.
7. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality triggered by the `reset` input.

The provided Verilog code should correctly implement the required serial byte reception functionality.'}
