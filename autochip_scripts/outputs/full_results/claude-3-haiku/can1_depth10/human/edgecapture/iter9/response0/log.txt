The main change is in the else condition. Previously, it was just checking for `!in[i]`, which would reset the output bit even if the input had not transitioned from 1 to 0. The corrected condition checks for `!in[i] && out[i]`, which ensures that the output bit is only reset when the input has transitioned from 1 to 0.'}
