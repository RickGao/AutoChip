assign d3 = x | ~q1;

// Output logic

endmodule

The main issues with the previous module were:
1. The complement of the flip-flop outputs were used incorrectly in the combinational logic.
2. The output logic for z was using XNOR instead of XOR.

With these corrections, the module should now pass the provided testbench.'}
