The Verilog module above implements the given finite state machine circuit. The key aspects are:

1. Declared three D flip-flop registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the state.
2. Assigned the next state values `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` to the D inputs of the flip-flops based on the input `x` and the current state.
3. Assigned the output `z` as the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
4. Assumed the flip-flops are initially reset to 0 before the machine begins.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the given finite state machine circuit.'}
