The main issue in the previous code was the incorrect combinational logic for the third D flip-flop. The second input of the OR gate should be the complemented output of the first flip-flop, not the complemented output.

Also, the output logic was incorrect. The XNOR gate should be replaced with an XOR gate to match the problem statement.

With these changes, the module should now correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem.'}
