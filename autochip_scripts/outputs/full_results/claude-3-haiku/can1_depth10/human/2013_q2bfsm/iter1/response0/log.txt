{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The main issues with the original code were:

1. The output `f` was not being set correctly. It should be set to 1 for one clock cycle after the reset is de-asserted, and then set to 0 afterwards.
2. The output `g` was not being set correctly. It should be set to 1 if `y` becomes 1 within 2 clock cycles after `x` has the sequence 1, 0, 1. If `y` does not become 1 within 2 clock cycles, then `g` should be set to 0 permanently.
3. The state transition logic was not correct. The state machine was not transitioning correctly between the states.

The corrected code addresses these issues and should pass the testbench.'}
