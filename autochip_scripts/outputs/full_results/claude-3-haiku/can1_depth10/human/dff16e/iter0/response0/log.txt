The provided Verilog module specification is correct and this implementation should work as expected. The key points are:

1. The module has 16-bit input `d` and output `q` to represent the 16 D flip-flops.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module first checks if the `resetn` signal is low (active-low reset). If so, it sets all the output bits `q` to 0.
4. If `resetn` is high, the module checks the `byteena` signal to determine which bytes of the input `d` should be written to the corresponding bytes of the output `q`.
   - If `byteena[0]` is high, the lower 8 bits of `q` are updated with the lower 8 bits of `d`.
   - If `byteena[1]` is high, the upper 8 bits of `q` are updated with the upper 8 bits of `d`.

This implementation should correctly create the 16 D flip-flops with byte-level write control and synchronous, active-low reset.'}
