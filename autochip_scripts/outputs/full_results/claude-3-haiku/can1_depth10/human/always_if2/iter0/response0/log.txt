```

The corrected code has the following changes:

1. The `reg` keyword is moved to the appropriate variable declarations.
2. In the first `always` block, the `else` condition is added to set `shut_off_computer` to 0 when `cpu_overheated` is false.
3. In the second `always` block, the negation operator `!` is used for the `arrived` condition, and the `else` condition is added to set `keep_driving` to 0 when `arrived` is true.

These changes fix the issues in the original code and ensure the module behaves as intended.'}
