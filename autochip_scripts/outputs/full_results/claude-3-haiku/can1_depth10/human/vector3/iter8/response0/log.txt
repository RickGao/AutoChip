assign y = concatenated_inputs[23:16];
assign z = concatenated_inputs[31:24];

endmodule

The issue with the previous module was that the assignment for the `z` output was incorrect. It should have been `concatenated_inputs[31:24]` instead of `{concatenated_inputs[29:24], 2'b11}`. This ensures that the two LSB bits of the `z` output are also part of the concatenated input, as specified in the problem statement.

With this correction, the module should now pass the provided testbench.'}
