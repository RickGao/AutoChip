The issue with the previous implementation was that the Verilog standard does not allow using `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` as a valid sensitivity list. Instead, the correct way to implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop is to have two separate `always` blocks, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge, as shown in the corrected module.

This should address the errors you encountered and pass the testbench simulation.'}
