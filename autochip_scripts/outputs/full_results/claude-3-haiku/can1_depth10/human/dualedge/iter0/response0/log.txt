The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The output `q` is then determined by a combinational logic block that selects the appropriate value based on the state of the two internal flip-flops.

This approach works around the FPGA limitation of not having native support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and provides the desired functionality.'}
