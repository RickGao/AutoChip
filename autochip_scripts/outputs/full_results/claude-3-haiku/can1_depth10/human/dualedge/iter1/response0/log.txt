The issue with the previous implementation was that the final `always` block was not updating the output `q` correctly. The corrected version uses a case statement to update `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`, which represent the value of the flip-flop on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.

This implementation should now correctly simulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
