The issue with the previous implementation was that the `q` output was being updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, which is not the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. To fix this, I've introduced an intermediate register `q_reg` that is updated on both edges of the clock, and then the `q` output is updated only on the positive edge.

This should now correctly implement the dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior.'}
