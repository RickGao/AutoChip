module top_module(

The issue with the previous implementation was that it used two separate flip-flops (one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge) and then used a combinational logic block to determine the final output. This approach would not correctly capture the behavior of a true dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

The corrected version uses a single always block that triggers on both the positive and negative edges of the clock. The if statement inside the block checks the value of the clock signal to determine whether to update the output based on the input `d`.

This implementation should now properly emulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
