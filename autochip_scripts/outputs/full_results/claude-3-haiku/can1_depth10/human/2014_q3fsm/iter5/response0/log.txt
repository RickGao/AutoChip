The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The main issues with the previous module were:
1. The state transition from state B to state C was triggered when `count` reached 2'b10 instead of 2'b11.
2. The state transition from state C to state B was triggered when `count` reached 2'b10 instead of 2'b11.

These issues have been corrected in the updated module. The module now correctly implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement.'}
