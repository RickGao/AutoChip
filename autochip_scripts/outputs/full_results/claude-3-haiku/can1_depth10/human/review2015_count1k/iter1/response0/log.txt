The main issue with the previous code was that the reset was not properly synchronized with the clock. The reset should be a synchronous reset, meaning that the state change should occur on the positive edge of the clock. By moving the reset logic inside the `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock, the reset is properly synchronized.'}
