This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1. When the counter value reaches 999, it is reset back to 0.

The counter value is represented using a 10-bit wide register `q`, which can hold values from 0 to 999.'}
