This Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator, as specified in the problem statement. The module uses a fast-running `clk` input and an `ena` signal to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second).

The module has the following key features:

1. The clock is initialized to "12:00 AM" when the `reset` signal is asserted.
2. The seconds, minutes, and hours are stored as 8-bit BCD values, as specified.
3. The `pm` output signal is used to indicate whether the clock is in the AM or PM period.
4. The clock increments the seconds, minutes, and hours appropriately, handling the rollover from 59 seconds to 0 seconds, 59 minutes to 0 minutes, and 12 hours to 1 hour (with the AM/PM toggle).

This Verilog module should correctly implement the specified 12-hour clock functionality.'}
