The issue with the previous implementation was that it was using a `case` statement instead of a `casez` statement. The `casez` statement is more appropriate for this type of priority encoder, as it allows for the detection of the first set bit in the input vector.

The corrected module uses `casez` to correctly handle the priority encoding and provide the appropriate output.'}
