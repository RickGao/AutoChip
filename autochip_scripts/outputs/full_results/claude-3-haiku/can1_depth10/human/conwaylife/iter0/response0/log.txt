{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15).

This Verilog module implements the Game of Life based on the provided specification. It has the following features:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and a 256-bit input `data` representing the initial state of the 16x16 grid.
2. The module maintains a 256-bit register `q` to store the current state of the grid.
3. The module has a combinational logic block that calculates the next state of the grid based on the current state and the rules of the Game of Life.
4. The module updates the state of the grid (`q`) on the positive edge of the clock, either loading the initial state from `data` if `load` is high, or updating the state based on the calculated next state.

The key aspects of the implementation are:
- The use of a nested loop to iterate over all 256 cells in the grid and calculate the number of alive neighbors for each cell.
- The application of the Game of Life rules to determine the next state of each cell based on the number of neighbors.
- The use of a separate `next_q` register to store the calculated next state before updating the `q` register.
- The handling of the toroidal wraparound by checking the neighboring cells at the grid edges.'}
