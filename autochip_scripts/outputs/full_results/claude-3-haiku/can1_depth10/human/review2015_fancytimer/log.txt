system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // We want to create a timer with one input that:

// (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input until it resumes searching after everything else is done.

// The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. 

// When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: The first test case should count for 2000 cycles. Your circuit counted 0
Hint: The second test case should count for 15000 cycles. Your circuit counted 1000
Hint: Your FSM didn't pass the sample timing diagram posted with the problem statement. Perhaps try debugging that?
