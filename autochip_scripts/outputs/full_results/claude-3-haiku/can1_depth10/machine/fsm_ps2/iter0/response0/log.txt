This Verilog module implements the state machine described in the problem statement. The module has four states: `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, `BYTE3`, and `DONE`. The state transitions are implemented in the `always @(*)` block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the value of the third bit of the input `in[2]`.

The `done` signal is asserted when the state machine is in the `DONE` state. The `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block handles the synchronous reset and updates the current state based on the next state.'}
