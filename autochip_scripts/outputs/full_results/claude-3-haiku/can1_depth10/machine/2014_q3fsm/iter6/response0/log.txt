The main issues in the original code were:

1. The initial state was not set correctly in the reset block.
2. The transition logic for some states was incorrect.
3. The output logic was missing the default case.

The corrected code sets the initial state to `A` in the reset block, fixes the state transition logic, and adds a default case for the output logic.'}
