system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple multiplexer. It takes two inputs, a and b, as well as a selector input, sel. It then outputs the value of either a or b, depending on the value of sel. If sel is 1, the output will be b, and if sel is 0, the output will be a. This module is useful for selecting between two different values, depending on the value of the selector.

	input a,
	input b,
