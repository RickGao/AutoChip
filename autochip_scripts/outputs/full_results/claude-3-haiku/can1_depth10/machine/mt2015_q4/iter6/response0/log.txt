The issues with the previous version were:
1. The `and` and `or` gates were not assigned to the intermediate wires properly. The `assign` statements were missing.
2. The logic for the second gate was incorrect. The `a2` and `b2` assignments were swapped.

This corrected version should pass the testbench simulation.'}
