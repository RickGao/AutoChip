endmodule

The issues with the previous module were:
1. In the second gate, the a2 input should be connected to x, not ~x.
2. The logic for the third gate was incorrect. It should be an OR gate, not an AND gate.

With these corrections, the module should work as expected and pass the given testbench.'}
