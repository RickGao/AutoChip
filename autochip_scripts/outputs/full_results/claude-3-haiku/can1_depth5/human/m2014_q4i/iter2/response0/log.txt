The warning was caused by the use of the `@*` construct, which is used to trigger an always block whenever any of the input variables change. However, in this case, there are no inputs, so the always block will never trigger.

To fix this, we can use the `always @()` construct instead, which will make the always block execute once during the initial evaluation. This way, the output `out` will be properly assigned to 0 without any warnings.'}
