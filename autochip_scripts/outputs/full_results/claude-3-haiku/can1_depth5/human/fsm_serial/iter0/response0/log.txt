{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine that identifies correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following functionality:

1. The module has four main states: `IDLE`, `START_BIT`, `DATA_BITS`, and `STOP_BIT`.
2. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. Once the start bit is detected, the module transitions to the `START_BIT` state.
4. In the `DATA_BITS` state, the module receives the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register, and keeping track of the number of bits received using the `bit_count` register.
5. When all 8 data bits have been received, the module transitions to the `STOP_BIT` state to verify the stop bit (1).
6. If the stop bit is correct (1), the `done` output is set high to indicate that a byte has been successfully received. If the stop bit is not correct (0), the module transitions to the `ERROR` state and waits for the next start bit to be detected.
7. In the `ERROR` state, the module resets the `bit_count` and `data_reg` registers, and waits for the next start bit to be detected.
8. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` input is high.

This implementation correctly identifies the start bit, receives the 8 data bits, and verifies the stop bit. If the stop bit is not correct, the module waits until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to receive the next byte.'}
