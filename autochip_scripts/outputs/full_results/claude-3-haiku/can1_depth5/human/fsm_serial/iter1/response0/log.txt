{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The main issue with the previous code was that the `done` signal was not being set correctly. The `done` signal should be set to 1 when a complete byte is received with a valid stop bit, and set to 0 otherwise. 

In the corrected code, the `done` signal is set to 1 in the `STOP_BIT` state when the input `in` is 1, indicating a valid stop bit. In all other states, the `done` signal is set to 0.

Additionally, the `ERROR` state was not handling the case where the input `in` is 1, which should transition the state back to `IDLE`.'}
