The issue with the previous implementation was that the output `q` was not being updated on the negedge of the clock. The fix is to update both `q_pos` and `q_neg` registers on the respective clock edges, and then use a combinational block to determine the final value of `q` based on the current clock value and the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

The updated module should now correctly implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
