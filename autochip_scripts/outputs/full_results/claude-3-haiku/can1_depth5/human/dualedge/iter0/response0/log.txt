endmodule
```

In this implementation, we have two separate flip-flop instances, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, that capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`, respectively. The final output `q` is then determined by a combinational logic block that selects the appropriate value from `q_pos` and `q_neg` based on the current state of the clock and the two flip-flop values.

This implementation provides the same functionality as a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while using only standard positive-edge-triggered flip-flops, which are natively supported by FPGAs.'}
