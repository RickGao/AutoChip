        S1: begin

            end
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule

The main changes are:
1. Added a check for `reg_value == 8'b0` in the `S1` state, and set `z` to `1'b0` in that case. This is to handle the case where the input is already zero, and the 2's complement should be zero.
2. Moved the assignment of `z` inside the `case` statement, so that it is updated correctly based on the current state.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the simulation.'}
