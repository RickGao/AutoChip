The issue with the previous implementation was that the `out` signal was declared as a `reg` type, which is not recommended for simple combinational logic like a multiplexer. Instead, the `out` signal should be declared as a `wire` type and the multiplexer logic should be implemented using the ternary operator `?:`.

This corrected module should now pass the provided testbench.'}
