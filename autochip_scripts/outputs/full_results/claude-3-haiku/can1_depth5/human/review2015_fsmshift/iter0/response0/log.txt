The corrected module implements the required functionality as follows:

1. The module has a `reset` input that is active high and synchronous.
2. The module has a `shift_ena` output that is used to enable the shift register.
3. The module has a `state` register that keeps track of the current state of the FSM.
4. The module has a `CYCLES` parameter that is set to 4, which represents the number of clock cycles the `shift_ena` signal should be asserted.
5. In the `RESET` state, the `shift_ena` signal is asserted and the state transitions to `IDLE` after 4 cycles.
6. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is deasserted.
7. If the `reset` signal is asserted, the module transitions to the `RESET` state and the `shift_ena` signal is asserted.

This module should function as expected and provide the necessary control signals for the shift register.'}
