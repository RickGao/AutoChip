The issues with the previous module were:
1. The CYCLES parameter was not being properly used to control the duration of the shift_ena assertion.
2. The state transitions were not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect behavior.

The corrected module uses a counter variable 'count' to track the number of cycles that shift_ena has been asserted, and transitions the state machine accordingly. The shift_ena signal is now asserted for exactly 4 cycles when the reset signal is activated, and remains de-asserted otherwise.'}
