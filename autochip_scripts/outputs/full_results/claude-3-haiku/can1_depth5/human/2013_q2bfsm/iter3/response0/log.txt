{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

```

The main changes are:

1. Added a `y_history` register to keep track of whether `y` has been 1 within the last 2 clock cycles.
2. In the `STATE_C` logic, check if `y` is 1 or `y_history` is 1 to determine if the next state should be `STATE_D`.
3. In the `STATE_C` logic, updated the `g` assignment to set it to 0 if `x_history` is not 101, instead of just setting it to 0 if `x_history` is 101.

These changes should fix the issues with the previous module and pass the testbench.'}
