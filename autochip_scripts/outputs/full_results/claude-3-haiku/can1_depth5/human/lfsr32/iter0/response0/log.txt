The provided Verilog module specification describes a 32-bit Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The module has a synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1`.

The corrected Verilog module implementation is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 32-bit width to hold the LFSR output.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, if the `reset` signal is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`.
4. If the `reset` signal is low, the next state of `q` is calculated by shifting the current value of `q` one bit to the left, and XORing the most significant bit (bit 31) with the bits at positions 21, 1, and 0.
5. This implements the Galois LFSR with the specified taps.'}
