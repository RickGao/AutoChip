{'assistant': 'I apologize for the previous mistake. Here's the corrected module:

module top_module(

    if (vibrate_mode) begin

The issue with the previous implementation was that the outputs `ringer` and `motor` were not properly assigned in the `else` block. The corrected module ensures that both `ringer` and `motor` are set to 0 when neither `vibrate_mode` nor `ring` is active.'}
