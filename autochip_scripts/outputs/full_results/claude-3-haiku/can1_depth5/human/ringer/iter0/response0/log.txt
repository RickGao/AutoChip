The original module specification had a minor issue - it did not use the `reg` keyword for the output ports `ringer` and `motor`, which are assigned values inside the always block. This has been corrected in the completed module.

The logic of the module is as follows:
1. If `vibrate_mode` is 1, turn on the motor and turn off the ringer.
2. If `ring` is 1 and `vibrate_mode` is 0, turn on the ringer and turn off the motor.
3. If neither `vibrate_mode` nor `ring` is 1, turn off both the ringer and the motor.'}
