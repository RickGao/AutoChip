The warnings in the original code were caused by the fact that the input vector `in` is 255 bits wide, but the part select used to extract the 8-bit groups was `[255:248]`, which is out of bounds. To fix this, the part select should be `[(i*8)+7:(i*8)]`, which correctly selects the 8-bit groups from the 255-bit input.

Additionally, the warning about the `@*` sensitivity list being sensitive to all 32 words in the `group_counts` array is not an issue, as the `always` block is correctly sensitive to all the elements of the array.'}
