The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should not have any errors. The issue with the testbench simulation might be due to a problem in the testbench itself or the way the test vectors are generated.

Please double-check the testbench to ensure that it is correctly stimulating the inputs and verifying the output of the `top_module`. You may also want to inspect the waveforms generated by the simulation to identify the specific input/output mismatches.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask.'}
