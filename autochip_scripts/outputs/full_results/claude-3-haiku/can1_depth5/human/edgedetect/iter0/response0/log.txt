The provided Verilog code correctly implements the module specification. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_prev` register stores the previous value of the `in` input signal.
2. In the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, the following happens:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in the `in_prev` register.
   - The `pedge` output is calculated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `in` and the negated previous value of `in` (`~in_prev`). This effectively sets the output bit to 1 only when the corresponding bit in `in` transitions from 0 to 1.

This module will correctly detect the 0 to 1 transitions on each bit of the 8-bit `in` vector and output the result in the `pedge` register.'}
