The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The key changes are:
1. Corrected the state transition logic in the WAIT_START state to properly detect the start pattern of 1101.
2. Moved the assignment of `next_state` inside the case statement to ensure it is updated correctly.
3. Corrected the `shift_ena` assignment in the SHIFT_DURATION state to turn off the shift enable after the 4 bits have been shifted in.
4. Corrected the logic in the NOTIFY_USER state to reset the `done` output when the user acknowledges the timer.

These changes should make the module pass the testbench.'}
