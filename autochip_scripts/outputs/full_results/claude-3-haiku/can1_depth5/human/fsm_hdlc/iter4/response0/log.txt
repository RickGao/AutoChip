Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous.

The main issues with the previous module were:

1. The reset signal was not properly handled. The state should be set to `IDLE` when the reset signal is high.
2. The `disc` and `flag` outputs were not being asserted correctly. They should be set to `1'b1` for one cycle when the corresponding condition is met.
3. The transition from the `FLAG` state to the `ERR` state was not handled correctly. If the input is `1'b1` in the `FLAG` state, the module should transition to the `ERR` state and set the `err` output to `1'b1`.

With these corrections, the module should now pass the given testbench.'}
