The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. The module uses a `case` statement to select the appropriate input based on the value of the `sel` signal. If `sel` is `0`, the output `out` is assigned the value of `a`, and if `sel` is `1`, the output `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

Additionally, in the default case, the output `out` is set to an unknown value `{100{1'bx}}` to handle the case where the select signal `sel` is an invalid value.'}
