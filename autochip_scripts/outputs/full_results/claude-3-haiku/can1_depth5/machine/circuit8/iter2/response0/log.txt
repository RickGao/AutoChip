The issue with the original module was that the second always block was only assigning the value of `a` to `p` when `a` was high, but it was not updating `p` when `a` was low. To fix this, I added an `else` block to the second always block to explicitly assign the previous value of `p` to `p` when `a` is low. This ensures that `p` is properly updated on every positive edge of the clock signal, regardless of the value of `a`.'}
