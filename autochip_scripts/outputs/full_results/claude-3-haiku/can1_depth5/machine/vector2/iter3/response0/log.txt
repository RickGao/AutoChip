The issue with the original module was that the output assignment was not correctly rearranging the 8-bit chunks of the input. The correct assignment is:

`{in[7:0], in[15:8], in[23:16], in[31:24]}`

This ensures that the first 8 bits of the input are assigned to the last 8 bits of the output, the second 8 bits of the input are assigned to the third 8 bits of the output, and so on.'}
