The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `d_last` register to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. Inside the `always` block, added the reset condition to initialize `out` and `d_last` to 0 when the reset signal is asserted.
3. On the positive edge of the clock, first assigned the current value of `in` to `d_last`, and then updated the value of `out` by ORing it with the bitwise AND of the negation of `in` and the previous value of `in` stored in `d_last`.

This ensures that the module behaves as per the given specification.'}
