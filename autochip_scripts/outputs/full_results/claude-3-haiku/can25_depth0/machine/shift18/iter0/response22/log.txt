This Verilog module implements the given specification. The top module has 8 inputs (clk, load, ena, amount[1:0], data[63:0]) and 1 output (q[63:0]). The module has 1 always block that is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal.

The always block first checks if the load signal is high, in which case, it assigns the input data[63:0] to the output q[63:0]. If the load signal is not high, it checks the ena signal. If ena is high, it performs a case statement on the amount[1:0] input:

- If amount is 2'b00, it shifts q[63:0] left by 1 bit, filling the LSB with 0.
- If amount is 2'b01, it shifts q[63:0] left by 8 bits, filling the LSBs with 0.
- If amount is 2'b10, it shifts q[63:0] right by 1 bit, filling the MSB with the previous MSB.
- If amount is 2'b11, it shifts q[63:0] right by 8 bits, filling the MSBs with the previous MSB.
- If amount is any other value, it assigns 64'hx to q[63:0].'}
