The corrected Verilog module addresses the following issues:

1. The `assign` statements for `next_state` ports were missing the `reg` keyword, so they were not being properly assigned. I have moved the logic to an `always` block to ensure proper assignment to the `next_state` output.

2. The logic for the `next_state` ports was not fully specified in the original description. I have added the complete logic based on the provided description.

3. The `out` port was not being assigned properly. I have added an `assign` statement to connect the `out` port to the appropriate bit of the `state` input.

The resulting module should now compile and function as described.'}
