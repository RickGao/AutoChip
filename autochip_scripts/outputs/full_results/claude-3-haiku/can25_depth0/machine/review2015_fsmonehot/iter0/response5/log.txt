The key changes made are:

1. Replaced the combinational logic with a single `always @(*) begin` block to handle the state-based output assignments.
2. Initialized all the output signals to 0 by default, and then set them to 1 based on the current state.
3. Implemented the state-based logic using a `case` statement on the `state` input.
4. Correctly assigned the values to the output signals based on the state and input conditions.

This should provide a complete and corrected Verilog module as per the given specification.'}
