{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This Verilog module is a simple counter that counts from 0 to 999. It has three ports, an input clock (clk), an input reset, and an output register (q).

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The implementation correctly handles the counter logic, incrementing the output register `q` on each positive edge of the clock, resetting it to 0 when `q` reaches 999, and resetting it to 0 when the `reset` input is active.'}
