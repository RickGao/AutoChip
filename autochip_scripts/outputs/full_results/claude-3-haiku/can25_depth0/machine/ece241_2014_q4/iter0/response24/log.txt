endmodule
```

The module correctly implements the given specification. The key points are:
1. Declaring the 3-bit register `s` with initial value 0.
2. Implementing the three statements in the always block using the cascade notation to access the individual bits of `s`.
3. Assigning the output `z` by taking the OR of all bits of `s` and negating the result.'}
