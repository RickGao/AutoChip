This Verilog module implements a simple toggle flip-flop. The `always_ff` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, and in that block, the output `out` is updated to the XOR of the current value of `out` and the input signal `in`. This causes the output `out` to toggle (change from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) every time the clock signal `clk` transitions from low to high.

The initial value of `out` is not specified in the module, so it will be initialized to 0 by default.'}
