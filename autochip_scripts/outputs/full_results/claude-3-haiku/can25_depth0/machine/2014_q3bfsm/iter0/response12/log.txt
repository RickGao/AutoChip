The module is completed according to the provided specification. It has a `clk` input, a `reset` input, an `x` input, and a `z` output. The state is represented using a 3-bit register `state`, which is initialized to `3'b000` (state A) on reset. The state transition logic is implemented using a `case` statement that updates the state based on the current state and the value of `x`. The output `z` is set high when the state is `3'b011` (state D) or `3'b100` (state E).'}
