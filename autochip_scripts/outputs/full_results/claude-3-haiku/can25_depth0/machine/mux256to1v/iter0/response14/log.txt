The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The implementation using the `assign` statement correctly selects the 4-bit block from the 1024-bit input vector `in` based on the 8-bit selection vector `sel`. The `sel * 4` calculates the starting index of the 4-bit block, and the `+: 4` extracts the 4-bit block from the input vector.'}
