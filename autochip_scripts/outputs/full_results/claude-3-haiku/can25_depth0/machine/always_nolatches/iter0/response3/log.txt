The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is provided above. The module takes a 16-bit `scancode` input and sets the corresponding `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up` outputs based on the input scancode value.

The key points in the completed module are:

1. Initialize all outputs to 0 in the `always` block to ensure a clean start.
2. Use a `case` statement to check the input `scancode` value and set the corresponding output to 1.
3. Use the specific scancode values provided in the specification (`16'h0E6B`, `16'h0E72`, `16'h0E74`, `16'h0E75`) to set the respective outputs.
4. Use the `default` case to handle any other scancode values that are not explicitly checked.

This completed module should work as per the given specification.'}
