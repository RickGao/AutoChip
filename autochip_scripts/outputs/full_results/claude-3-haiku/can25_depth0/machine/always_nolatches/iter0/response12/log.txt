The corrected module sets the respective output signals based on the input `scancode` value. The key changes are:

1. Initialized the output signals `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up` to 0 in the `always` block to ensure they are cleared before setting them.
2. Used a `case` statement to check the `scancode` value and set the corresponding output signal to 1.
3. Added a `default` case to ensure the outputs are 0 for any other `scancode` value not specified.

This should correctly implement the desired functionality.'}
