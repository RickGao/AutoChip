system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple combinational logic circuit. It has three ports: an input port 'd', an enable port 'ena', and an output port 'q'. The enable port is used to control the output port. When the enable port is active (high), the output port will be equal to the value of the input port. When the enable port is inactive (low), the output port will remain unchanged. This module is useful for controlling the flow of data in a circuit, as it allows the user to enable or disable the flow of data from the input port to the output port.
