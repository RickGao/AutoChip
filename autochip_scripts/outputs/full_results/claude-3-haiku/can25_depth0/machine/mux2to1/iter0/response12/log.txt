The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. I have added the `reg` keyword to the `out` output declaration to make it a register type, as the output is being assigned inside an always block.
2. I have used a case statement to handle the two possible values of `sel` and assign the corresponding value to `out`.
3. I have added a `default` case to handle any invalid values of `sel`, which will result in an 'x' value being assigned to `out`.'}
