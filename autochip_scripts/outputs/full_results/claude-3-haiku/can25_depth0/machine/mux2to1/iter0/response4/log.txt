The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the code above represents the completed Verilog module. The primary changes made are:

1. Declared `out` as a `reg` type to allow for assignment within the `always` block.
2. Added a `case` statement to handle the different values of `sel` and assign the appropriate value to `out`.
3. Added a `default` case to assign a don't-care value (`1'bx`) for any other case not explicitly handled.

This ensures that the module correctly selects between the input values `a` and `b` based on the value of the `sel` input, and produces the expected output.'}
