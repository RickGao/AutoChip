The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Added `reg` declarations for the state variable and output variables `f` and `g`.
2. Initialized the state variable to `A` in the reset condition.
3. Initialized the output variables `f` and `g` to 0 in the reset condition.
4. Added a `case` statement to update the state based on the current state and input variables `x` and `y`.
5. Added a separate `case` statement to update the output variables `f` and `g` based on the current state.

The module now correctly implements the given finite state machine (FSM) behavior.'}
