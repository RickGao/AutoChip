The provided Verilog code implements the given Finite State Machine (FSM) specification. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `resetn`: Active-low reset signal
- `x`: Input signal
- `y`: Input signal

Outputs:
- `f`: Output signal
- `g`: Output signal

The module uses a 3-bit state variable `state` to represent the current state of the FSM, with the following state assignments:
- `A` = 3'b000
- `B` = 3'b001
- `S0` = 3'b010
- `S1` = 3'b011
- `S10` = 3'b100
- `G1` = 3'b101
- `G2` = 3'b110
- `P0` = 3'b111
- `P1` = 3'b111

The `next_state` logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals `x` and `y`.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the `state` register based on the `next_state` logic.

The `always @(*)` block sets the output signals `f` and `g` based on the current state. The output `f` is set to 1 when the state is `B`, and the output `g` is set to 1 when the state is `G1`, `G2`, or `P1`.

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the given FSM specification.'}
