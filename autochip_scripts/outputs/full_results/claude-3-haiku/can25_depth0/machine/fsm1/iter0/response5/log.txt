The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in`, and `areset`.
2. The module has one output: `out`.
3. The module uses a single reg variable `state` to keep track of the current state, which can be either `STATE_A` or `STATE_B`.
4. The state transitions are determined by the value of the `in` input signal and the current state:
   - If the current state is `STATE_A` and `in` is high, the next state is `STATE_A`.
   - If the current state is `STATE_A` and `in` is low, the next state is `STATE_B`.
   - If the current state is `STATE_B` and `in` is high, the next state is `STATE_B`.
   - If the current state is `STATE_B` and `in` is low, the next state is `STATE_A`.
5. The state is updated on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
6. The state is reset to `STATE_B` on the rising edge of the `areset` signal.
7. The `out` output is assigned the value of the `state` variable, which means it will be high when the state is `STATE_B` and low otherwise.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified state machine behavior.'}
