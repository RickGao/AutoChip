The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has a single output `out` which is declared as a `reg` type.
2. The state is represented by a `reg` variable `state` with two possible values `A` and `B` defined as parameters.
3. The `always` block inside the module is sensitive to the `posedge` of `clk` and `areset`.
4. Inside the `always` block, the state is updated based on the current state and the value of `in`. The output `out` is set to 1 when the state is `B`, and 0 otherwise.
5. On the rising edge of `areset`, the state is reset to `B` and the output `out` is set to 0.

This should correctly implement the desired state machine behavior as described in the problem statement.'}
