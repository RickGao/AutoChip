The original code had a few issues:
1. The first 25-bit vector was constructed incorrectly. It should be `~{5{a}, 5{b}, 5{c}, 5{d}, 5{e}}` instead of `{5{a}, 5{b}, 5{c}, 5{d}, 5{e}}`.
2. The second 25-bit vector was also constructed incorrectly. It should be `{5{a,b,c,d,e}}` instead of `{a,b,c,d,e}`.
3. The bitwise exclusive-or operation was missing in the original code. I've added the `out = vec1 ^ vec2` assignment to compute the final output.

The corrected Verilog module should now work as expected.'}
