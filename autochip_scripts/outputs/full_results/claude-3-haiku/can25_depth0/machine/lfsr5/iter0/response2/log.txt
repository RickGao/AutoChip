The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as shown above. The module has two always blocks:

1. The first always block is a combinational logic block that defines the next state of the 5-bit register `q_next`. It assigns the upper 4 bits of `q_next` with the upper 4 bits of the current `q` register, the most significant bit of `q_next` with the least significant bit of the current `q` register, and the second least significant bit of `q_next` with the XOR of the least significant bit of `q_next` and the least significant bit of the current `q` register.

2. The second always block is a sequential logic block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. It assigns the 5-bit `q` register based on the value of the `reset` signal. If `reset` is active, `q` is assigned the value `5'h1`. Otherwise, `q` is assigned the value of `q_next`, which is the next state computed in the first always block.

This module correctly implements the specified state transition logic and the reset functionality.'}
