The Verilog module you provided has a couple of issues that I have addressed in the corrected version:

1. The first `always` block was triggered on the negative edge of the clock signal (`@(negedge clock)`), which means the value of `a` would be assigned to `q` on the falling edge of the clock. This has been corrected to use the negative edge trigger.

2. The second `always` block was triggered on any change of the input signal `a` (`@(a)`), which means the value of `a` would be assigned to `p` on any change of `a`, regardless of the clock signal. This has been corrected to check if the clock signal is high before assigning the value of `a` to `p`.

The corrected Verilog module should now function as expected, with `q` being assigned the current value of `a` on the negative edge of the clock, and `p` being assigned the current value of `a` on the positive edge of the clock.'}
