The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The state register is a 3-bit register that can hold the states B0 (000), B1 (001), B2 (010), B3 (011), and Done (100).
2. The state transition logic is implemented in the first `always` block, which updates the state on the positive edge of the clock.
   - On reset, the state is set to B0 (000).
   - The state transitions from B0 to B1, B1 to B2, B2 to B3, and B3 to Done.
   - If the state is not one of the valid states (B0, B1, B2, or B3), it is set to B0.
3. The `shift_ena` output is set to 1 when the state is B0, B1, B2, or B3, and 0 when the state is Done or any other invalid state.

This implementation correctly implements the given Verilog module specification.'}
