```

The key changes made are:

1. Declared the state register as a 3-bit register `state`.
2. Defined the state parameters using `localparam`.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
4. Implemented the `shift_ena` output logic in a separate `always` block that assigns the output based on the current state.
5. Ensured that the state always transitions to `DONE` when not in the expected states (`B0`, `B1`, `B2`, or `B3`).

This module should now correctly implement the desired behavior.'}
