The changes made are:

1. Added a 2-bit state register `state` and a 2-bit next state register `next_state`.
2. Defined the state parameters `S`, `S1`, and `S10`.
3. Added an `always` block to update the state register `state` on the positive edge of `clk` or when `aresetn` is low.
4. Added an `always` block to compute the next state `next_state` based on the current state `state` and the input `x`.
5. Added an `always` block to compute the output `z` based on the current state `state`.

This Verilog module should now correctly implement the given state transition and output logic.'}
