The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is provided above. The module implements a two-state state machine with two inputs `j` and `k`, and one output `out`. The state is initialized to `A` and transitions to `B` when `j` is high, and from `B` to `A` when `k` is high. The output `out` is high when the state is `B` and low when the state is `A`.

The module uses a `reg` variable `state` to store the current state, and a `always` block to update the state based on the inputs `j`, `k`, and `reset`. Another `always` block is used to set the output `out` based on the current state.'}
