```

The changes made are:

1. Declared the state register as a `reg` type.
2. Defined the parameters `A` and `B` for the two states.
3. Moved the state update logic to the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block, where the state is updated on the positive edge of the clock or when the reset signal is high.
4. Added a separate `always @(*)` block to assign the output `out` based on the current state.

This corrected module should now compile and function as described in the given specification.'}
