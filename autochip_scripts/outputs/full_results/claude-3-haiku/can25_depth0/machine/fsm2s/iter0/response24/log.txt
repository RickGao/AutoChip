The corrected Verilog module contains the following changes:

1. Declared `out` as a `reg` type output, as it is assigned a value in the always block.
2. Defined the two states, `A` and `B`, as `parameter` constants.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the first always block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the reset signal.
4. Implemented the output logic in the second always block, which assigns the appropriate value to the `out` signal based on the current state.

The module now correctly implements the two-state state machine with the specified behavior.'}
