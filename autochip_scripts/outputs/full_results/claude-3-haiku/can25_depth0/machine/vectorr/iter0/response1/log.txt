The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

The module takes an 8-bit input `in` and assigns the output `out` by reversing the order of the bits in `in`. This is achieved using the Verilog concatenation operator `{}`, which allows you to combine the individual bits of `in` in the desired order.

The line `assign out = {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};` assigns the output `out` by concatenating the individual bits of `in` in reverse order, effectively reversing the order of the bits.'}
