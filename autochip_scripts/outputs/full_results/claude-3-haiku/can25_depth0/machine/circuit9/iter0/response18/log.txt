module top_module (

    if (a) begin

        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

The main changes are:

1. Added the `always @(posedge clk)` block to synchronize the logic with the clock.
2. Added the `if (a)` condition to set `q` to 4 when `a` is 1.
3. Added the `case` statement to handle the different conditions for `q`:
   - When `q` is 6, set it to 0.
   - For all other cases, increment `q` by 1.

This implementation should correctly implement the Mealy machine described in the specification.'}
