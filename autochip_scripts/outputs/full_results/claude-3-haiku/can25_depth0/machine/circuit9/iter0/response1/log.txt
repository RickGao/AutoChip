The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`).
2. Inside the `always` block, the logic for updating the output `q` is as follows:
   - If `a` is 1, set `q` to 4 (`q <= 3'd4;`).
   - If `a` is 0, check the current value of `q`:
     - If `q` is 6, set `q` to 0 (`q <= 3'd0;`).
     - If `q` is not 6, increment `q` by 1 (`q <= q + 3'd1;`).

This Verilog module correctly implements the Mealy machine behavior as described in the problem statement.'}
