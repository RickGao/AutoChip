The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The module takes a 32-bit input vector `in` and reverses the byte order to produce the 32-bit output vector `out`. This is achieved by the following assignments:

1. `out[7:0]` is assigned the most significant byte of `in` (bits 31 to 24).
2. `out[15:8]` is assigned the second most significant byte of `in` (bits 23 to 16).
3. `out[23:16]` is assigned the third most significant byte of `in` (bits 15 to 8).
4. `out[31:24]` is assigned the least significant byte of `in` (bits 7 to 0).

The completed Verilog module is provided above, and no corrections are necessary.'}
