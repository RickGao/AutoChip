This Verilog module implements a 4-bit shift register with the following functionality:

1. `areset`: Resets the shift register to zero asynchronously on the positive edge of the `areset` signal.
2. `load`: Loads the shift register with the `data[3:0]` value synchronously on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, regardless of the `ena` signal.
3. `ena`: Shifts the contents of the shift register one bit to the right, with the most significant bit (`q[3]`) becoming zero, and the least significant bit (`q[0]`) being shifted out and disappearing. This shift operation happens synchronously on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, unless the `load` signal is asserted, which has higher priority.
4. `q`: The current contents of the 4-bit shift register.

The module uses a single `always` block to handle the asynchronous reset, synchronous load, and synchronous shift operations based on the input signals.'}
