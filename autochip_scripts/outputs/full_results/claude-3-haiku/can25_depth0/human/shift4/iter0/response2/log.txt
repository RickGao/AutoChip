The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is provided above. The key points are:

1. The module has an asynchronous positive edge triggered reset (areset) which resets the shift register to zero.
2. The load input has higher priority than the enable (ena) input. If both are asserted, the module will load the data into the shift register instead of shifting.
3. The shift right operation is implemented by shifting the contents of the register one bit to the right, with the most significant bit (q[3]) becoming zero.
4. The output q is a 4-bit register that holds the contents of the shift register.

The module is complete and should compile and function correctly based on the given specification.'}
