{'assistant': 'Here is the completed Verilog module with 8 D flip-flops with active high asynchronous reset:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    input areset,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        q <= 8'b0;
    end
    else begin
        q <= d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. Declare `q` as a `reg` output to support the flip-flop behavior.
2. Use the `always` block to describe the behavior of the flip-flops.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or the positive edge of `areset`.
4. Inside the `always` block, check for the `areset` condition first and assign `8'b0` to `q` if `areset` is high.
5. If `areset` is low, assign the input `d` to the output `q`.

This will create 8 D flip-flops with active high asynchronous reset, where the output `q` is reset to 0 when `areset` is high, and is updated with the input `d` on the positive edge of `clk`.'}
