This module includes a flip-flop that is controlled by the input signals. When the `L` signal is asserted, the flip-flop loads the value from the `R` input. When the `E` signal is asserted, the flip-flop shifts in the value from the `w` input. The `Q` output reflects the current state of the flip-flop.'}
