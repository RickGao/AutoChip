The completed Verilog module for the n-bit shift register circuit is as follows:

1. The module is named `top_module` and takes the following inputs:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
   - `R`: The n-bit value to be loaded into the shift register.
   - `E`: The enable signal for shifting.
   - `L`: The signal to load the value from `R` into the shift register.
2. The module has a single output:
   - `Q`: The n-bit output of the shift register.
3. The module uses a single `always` block to handle the logic of the shift register:
   - If `L` is asserted, the value from `R` is loaded into the shift register (`Q <= R`).
   - If `E` is asserted, the contents of the shift register are shifted one position to the left, with the least significant bit being replaced by the input `w` (`Q <= {Q[n-2:0], w}`).

This Verilog module implements the n-bit shift register circuit as described in the specification.'}
