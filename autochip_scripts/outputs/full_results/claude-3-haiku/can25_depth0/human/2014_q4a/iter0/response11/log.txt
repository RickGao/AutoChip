The Verilog module `top_module` represents a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs and output:

- `clk`: clock signal
- `w`: input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: value to load into the register
- `E`: enable signal for shifting
- `L`: signal to load the value `R` into the register

The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The block performs the following logic:

1. If the `L` signal is high, the output `Q` is assigned the value of `R`, effectively loading the value into the register.
2. If the `E` signal is high, the output `Q` is assigned the value of `w`, effectively shifting the input into the register.

This completed Verilog module implements the desired functionality for a single stage of the n-bit shift register circuit.'}
