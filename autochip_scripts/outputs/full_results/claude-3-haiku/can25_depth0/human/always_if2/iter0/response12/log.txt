The original code had a few issues:

1. The `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` outputs were not initialized, leading to potential compilation errors. I've added the `reg` keyword to declare them as registers.
2. The `always` block for `shut_off_computer` was missing the `else` condition, which would have led to a compilation error. I've added the `else` condition to ensure the output is properly assigned.
3. The `always` block for `keep_driving` was using the wrong logic for the `arrived` signal. It should be `!arrived` to keep driving when the destination has not been reached. I've updated the logic accordingly.

The corrected module should now compile and function as expected.'}
