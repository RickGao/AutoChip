The provided Verilog module correctly implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and keeps it set until a reset is detected.

The module has three states: `IDLE`, `SEARCH`, and `FOUND`. The `shift_reg` register is used to store the last 4 bits of the input data stream. The state transitions are as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, if the `shift_reg` contains the pattern 1101, the next state is `FOUND`. Otherwise, the next state is `SEARCH`.
2. In the `SEARCH` state, if the `shift_reg` contains the pattern 1101, the next state is `FOUND`.
3. In the `FOUND` state, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains set until a reset occurs.

The module also handles the reset signal, which synchronously resets the state to `IDLE` and clears the `start_shifting` output.'}
