The provided Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence '1101' in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and holds it there until the `reset` signal is activated.

The module has three states:
1. `SEARCH`: The initial state where the module searches for the sequence '1101'. If the input `data` is '1', it transitions to the `FOUND` state.
2. `FOUND`: When the first three bits of the sequence '110' are detected, the module transitions to this state. If the next bit is '0', it transitions back to the `SEARCH` state. If the next bit is '1', it transitions to the `HOLD` state and sets `start_shifting` to 1.
3. `HOLD`: In this state, the module holds the `start_shifting` output at 1 until the `reset` signal is activated.

The module uses a `case` statement to handle the state transitions and update the `start_shifting` output accordingly.'}
