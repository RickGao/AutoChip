The module above implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in the input data stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, which remains high until the `reset` signal is asserted.

The module uses five states to represent the different stages of the sequence detection:
- `S0`: Waiting for the first '0' in the sequence.
- `S1`: Waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.
- `S2`: Waiting for the second '1' in the sequence.
- `S3`: Waiting for the '0' after the second '1'.
- `S4`: The sequence has been found, set `start_shifting` to 1.

The `next_state` logic transitions between these states based on the current input data value. When the final state `S4` is reached, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high until the `reset` signal is asserted, which transitions the state machine back to the initial state `S0`.'}
