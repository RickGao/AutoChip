The provided Verilog module is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, and keeps it at 1 until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module has four states: `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, and `S3`. The state transitions are based on the current state and the input `data` bit. When the sequence "1101" is detected, the state machine transitions to `S3`, and the `start_shifting` output is set to 1.

The module also includes synchronous reset functionality, where the state machine is reset to `S0` and `start_shifting` is set to 0 when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
