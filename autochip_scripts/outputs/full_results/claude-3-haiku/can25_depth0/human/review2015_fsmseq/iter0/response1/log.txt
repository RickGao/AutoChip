The Verilog module given is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and holds it there until reset.

The module has four states:
1. `S0`: The initial state, waiting for a '1' to start the sequence.
2. `S1`: The second state, waiting for another '1' after the first one.
3. `S2`: The third state, waiting for a '0' after the two '1's.
4. `S3`: The final state, where the sequence 1101 has been detected and `start_shifting` is set to 1.

The module uses a case statement to transition between the states based on the input `data`. When the sequence 1101 is detected in `S3`, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high until reset.

The reset signal is handled synchronously, where the state is reset to `S0` and `start_shifting` is set to 0.'}
