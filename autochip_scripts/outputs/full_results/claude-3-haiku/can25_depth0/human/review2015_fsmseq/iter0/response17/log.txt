The provided Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output signal to 1 and maintains it in that state until the `reset` signal is activated.

The module defines three states: `IDLE`, `SEARCHING`, and `FOUND`. The state transitions are as follows:

1. `IDLE`: The module waits for the first '1' in the input stream to begin the search.
2. `SEARCHING`: The module checks the input bit stream for the sequence "1101". If the sequence is found, it transitions to the `FOUND` state. If a '0' is encountered, it returns to the `IDLE` state.
3. `FOUND`: The module sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and remains in this state until the `reset` signal is activated.

The module uses a case statement to handle the state transitions and update the `start_shifting` output accordingly.'}
