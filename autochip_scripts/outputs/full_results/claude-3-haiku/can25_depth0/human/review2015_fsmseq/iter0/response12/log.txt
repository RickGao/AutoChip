The provided Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream. It uses a 4-bit shift register to keep track of the last four bits received. The module has three states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the module waits for the sequence "1101" to appear.
2. `SEARCH`: The state where the module is actively searching for the sequence "1101".
3. `FOUND`: The state where the sequence "1101" has been found, and the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 until the module is reset.

The module transitions between these states based on the contents of the shift register and the current state. When the sequence "1101" is detected, the module enters the `FOUND` state and sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, which remains set until the module is reset.'}
