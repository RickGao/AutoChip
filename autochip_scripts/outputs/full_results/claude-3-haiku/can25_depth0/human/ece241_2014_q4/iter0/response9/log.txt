This Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. The key components are:

1. Three D flip-flops (q1, q2, q3) to store the state of the circuit.
2. Three combinational logic gates (XOR, AND, OR) that take the input `x` and the current state of the flip-flops to generate the next state (d1, d2, d3).
3. The D flip-flops are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal, storing the next state.
4. The output `z` is generated using a 3-input XNOR gate that takes the outputs of the three flip-flops.

The initial reset condition for the D flip-flops is not explicitly specified in the Verilog code, but it is assumed that the flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins operation.'}
