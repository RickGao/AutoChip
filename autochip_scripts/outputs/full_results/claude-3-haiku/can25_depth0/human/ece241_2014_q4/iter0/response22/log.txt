The provided Verilog code implements the given finite state machine circuit. It includes the following components:

1. `top_module`: This is the main module that instantiates the D flip-flops and implements the combinational logic.
2. `dff`: This is a helper module that defines a D flip-flop with synchronous reset.

In the `top_module`, the input `x` is connected to three different gates (XOR, AND, and OR) whose outputs are connected to the D inputs of the three D flip-flops (`dff1`, `dff2`, and `dff3`). The flip-flop outputs (`q1`, `q2`, and `q3`) and their complementary outputs (`q1_bar`, `q2_bar`, and `q3_bar`) are used as the second inputs to the corresponding gates.

Finally, the outputs of the three flip-flops are connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is the final output `z`.

The `dff` module implements a simple D flip-flop with synchronous reset, where the output `q` is assigned the value of the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock signal.'}
