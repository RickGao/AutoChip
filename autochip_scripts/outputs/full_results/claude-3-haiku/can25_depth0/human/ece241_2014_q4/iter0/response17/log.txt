The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It consists of the `top_module` which contains the three D flip-flops, the gates, and the output logic. The `dff` module is a simple D flip-flop implementation.

The inputs to the gates are connected as follows:
- The XOR gate has `x` as one input and the corresponding flip-flop output `q1` as the other input.
- The AND gate has `x` as one input and the corresponding flip-flop complemented output `q2_bar` as the other input.
- The OR gate has `x` as one input and the corresponding flip-flop complemented output `q3_bar` as the other input.

The outputs of the three flip-flops are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, which produces the final output `z`.'}
