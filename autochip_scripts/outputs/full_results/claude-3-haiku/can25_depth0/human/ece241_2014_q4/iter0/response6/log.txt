The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The module has three state bits to represent the current state of the flip-flops.
2. The `always` block updates the state on the positive edge of the clock signal. It shifts the current state bits to the left and assigns the new input `x` to the least significant bit.
3. The combinational logic is implemented using the following assignments:
   - `xor_out` is the XOR of the input `x` and the first state bit `state[0]`.
   - `and_out` is the AND of the input `x` and the complement of the first state bit `~state[0]`.
   - `or_out` is the OR of the input `x` and the complement of the first state bit `~state[0]`.
4. The output `z` is assigned the negation of the XNOR of `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out`.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement.'}
