The key steps in this Verilog implementation are:

1. Declare the D flip-flops and their complementary outputs.
2. Calculate the combinational logic for the D flip-flop inputs using XOR, AND, and OR gates.
3. Update the D flip-flops on the positive edge of the clock.
4. Calculate the final output using a 3-input XNOR gate on the D flip-flop outputs.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops is assumed to be handled externally, as the problem statement does not mention any reset signal.'}
