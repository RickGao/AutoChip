The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the following features:

1. Declaration of the three D flip-flop registers: `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.

2. Combinational logic for the three gate inputs:
   - `xor_in = x ^ q1`
   - `and_in = x & ~q2`
   - `or_in = x | ~q3`

3. D flip-flop logic, where the flip-flop inputs are assigned on the positive edge of the clock signal.

4. The final 3-input XNOR gate for the output `z`, which is the negation of the XOR of `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.

The initial reset of the D flip-flops to zero is assumed to be handled externally, before the circuit starts operation.'}
