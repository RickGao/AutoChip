The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It declares the three D flip-flop registers `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, and their corresponding outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`. The `always` block updates the D flip-flop values and outputs on the positive edge of the clock.

The combinational logic for the three gates (XOR, AND, and OR) and the final XNOR gate are implemented using Verilog assignments. The XOR gate takes `x` and `q1` as inputs, the AND gate takes `x` and the complemented `q2` as inputs, and the OR gate takes `x` and the complemented `q3` as inputs. The final output `z` is the XNOR of these three gate outputs.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the given finite state machine circuit.'}
