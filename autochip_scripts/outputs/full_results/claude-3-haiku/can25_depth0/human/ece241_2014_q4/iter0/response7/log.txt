The corrected Verilog module has the following features:

1. Declared a 3-bit register `state` to store the current state of the finite state machine.
2. Assigned the incoming input `x` to the least significant bit of the `state` register on each clock cycle.
3. Calculated the XOR, AND, and OR outputs using the current state.
4. Assigned the XNOR of the XOR, AND, and OR outputs to the output `z`.

This implementation correctly captures the behavior of the given finite state machine circuit.'}
