The corrected Verilog module implements the given finite state machine circuit description. The key changes are:

1. Declared three internal registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
2. In the `always` block for the D flip-flops, the input `x` is combined with the current state of the flip-flop using the appropriate logical operation (XOR, AND, and OR) and assigned back to the flip-flop.
3. The three-input XNOR gate is implemented using the `assign` statement, which negates the XOR of the three flip-flop outputs.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the given finite state machine circuit.'}
