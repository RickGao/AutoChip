The provided Verilog module is correct and should implement the desired decade counter functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the active-high synchronous reset signal).
2. The module has one output: `q`, which is a 4-bit register to store the counter value.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. Inside the `always` block, the module first checks if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, the counter value `q` is reset to `4'b0`.
5. If the `reset` signal is not high, the module checks if the current value of `q` is `4'd9` (the maximum value for a decade counter). If so, the counter is reset to `4'b0`.
6. If the current value of `q` is not `4'd9`, the counter is incremented by `4'b1`.

This implementation correctly implements the required decade counter functionality.'}
