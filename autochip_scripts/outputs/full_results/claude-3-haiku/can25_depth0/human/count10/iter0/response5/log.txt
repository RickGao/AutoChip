This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block checks for the reset signal on the positive edge of the clock. If the reset signal is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1, and if the counter reaches 9 (4'b1001), it is reset to 0.'}
