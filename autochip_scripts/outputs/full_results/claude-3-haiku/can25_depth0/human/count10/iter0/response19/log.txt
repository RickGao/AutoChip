The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` takes two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (active-high synchronous reset), and one output `q` (a 4-bit register that holds the counter value).
2. The `always` block inside the module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, the counter value `q` is reset to `4'd0` (decimal 0).
4. If the `reset` signal is not high, the module checks if the current value of `q` is equal to `4'd9` (decimal 9). If it is, the counter is reset to `4'd0`, effectively wrapping around from 9 to 0.
5. If the current value of `q` is not 9, the module simply increments the counter by `4'd1` (decimal 1).

This implementation correctly implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets the counter to 0 when the `reset` signal is active high.'}
