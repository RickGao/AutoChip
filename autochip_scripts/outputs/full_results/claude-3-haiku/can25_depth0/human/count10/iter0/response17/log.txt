The provided Verilog module correctly implements a decade counter with a synchronous reset. The counter counts from 0 through 9 (inclusive) with a period of 10. The reset input is active high and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses the following logic:

1. On the positive edge of the clock `clk`, the module checks the reset signal `reset`.
2. If `reset` is high, the counter `q` is set to 0.
3. If `reset` is low, the module checks the current value of `q`.
4. If `q` is equal to 9 (the maximum value), it is reset to 0.
5. Otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures the correct behavior of the decade counter.'}
