The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given Moore state machine specification. The state variables `state` are used to track the current state of the machine, with `OFF` and `ON` as the two possible states. The output `out` is set based on the current state.

The module handles the synchronous reset correctly, transitioning to the `OFF` state and setting the output to 0 when the `reset` input is high. The state transitions and output updates are performed in the `always` block based on the current state and the input signals `j` and `k`.'}
