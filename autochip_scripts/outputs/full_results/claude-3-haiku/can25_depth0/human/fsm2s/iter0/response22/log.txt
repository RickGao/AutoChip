This Verilog code implements the Moore state machine as described in the specification. The key points are:

1. The state machine has two states, `OFF` and `ON`, defined as parameters.
2. The `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals `j` and `k`.
3. The output `out` is directly assigned the current state value.
4. The state register updates the current state to the next state on the positive edge of the clock, and resets to `OFF` when the `reset` signal is high.

This module should compile and function correctly according to the given specification.'}
