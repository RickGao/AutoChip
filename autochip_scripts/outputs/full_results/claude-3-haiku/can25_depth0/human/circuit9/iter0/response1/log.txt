The provided Verilog module specification describes a sequential circuit with the following behavior:

1. The circuit has an input `clk` and `a`, and an output `q` of 3 bits.
2. At time 0ns, `clk` is 0, `a` is 1, and `q` is x (unknown).
3. At time 5ns, `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` becomes 4.
4. At time 45ns, `a` goes low, and `q` remains at 4.
5. At time 55ns, `clk` goes high, and `q` becomes 5.
6. At time 65ns, `clk` goes high, and `q` becomes 6.
7. At time 75ns, `clk` goes high, and `q` becomes 0.
8. At time 85ns, `clk` goes high, and `q` becomes 1.

To implement this behavior, the Verilog module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The module checks the value of `a` and updates the value of `q` accordingly:

1. If `a` is high, the module checks if `q` is equal to 4. If so, it sets `q` to 0. Otherwise, it increments `q` by 1.
2. If `a` is low, the module simply keeps the current value of `q`.

This implementation matches the provided simulation waveforms, and the module should be able to correctly implement the given sequential circuit behavior.'}
