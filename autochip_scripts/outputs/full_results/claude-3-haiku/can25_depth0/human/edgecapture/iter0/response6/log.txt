```

The key changes are:

1. Added `reg` for the output port `out` to make it a writable register.
2. Moved the entire logic inside an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Added a check for the reset signal and reset the `out` register to 0 if the reset is active.
4. Added a `for` loop to iterate over the 32 bits of the input and output vectors.
5. Checked if the current bit of the input is 1 and the corresponding bit of the output is 0, then set the output bit to 1.
6. Checked if the current bit of the input is 0, then set the corresponding bit of the output to 0.

This ensures that the output bit is set to 1 when the input changes from 1 to 0 and remains 1 until the register is reset.'}
