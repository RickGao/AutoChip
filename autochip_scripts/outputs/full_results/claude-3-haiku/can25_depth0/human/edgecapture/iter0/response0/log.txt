The provided Verilog module correctly captures the change in each bit of the 32-bit input vector from 1 to 0 and sets the corresponding bit in the output vector to 1 until the register is reset. The key aspects are:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
2. Inside the `always` block, the logic checks if the reset signal is active. If so, it resets the output vector to all 0s.
3. If the reset is not active, the code iterates through each bit of the input vector. For each bit, it checks if the current bit is 1 and the previous bit (from the previous clock cycle) was 0. If so, it sets the corresponding bit in the output vector to 1.
4. This capture mechanism ensures that the output bit remains 1 until the register is reset, even if the input bit subsequently changes back to 1.'}
