The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have an active-high synchronous reset that resets the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implements this functionality as follows:

1. The `q` register is declared as a 5-bit wide register to hold the LFSR state.
2. In the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the `q` register is assigned the value `5'b00001`, which sets the initial state of the LFSR to 1.
   - If the `reset` signal is low, the LFSR is updated by shifting the current state one bit to the left and XORing the most significant bit (`q[4]`) with the bit at position 2 (`q[2]`) to produce the new least significant bit.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
