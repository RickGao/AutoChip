The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximum-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should reset to 1 when the active-high synchronous reset signal is asserted.

The corrected Verilog module implementation includes the following:

1. The `next_q` register to hold the next state of the LFSR.
2. The first `always` block that updates the `q` register on the positive edge of the clock, resetting to 5'b00001 when the `reset` signal is active.
3. The second `always` block that calculates the next state of the LFSR based on the Galois LFSR structure, where the bit at position 4 is assigned the value of the bit at position 0, the bit at position 3 is the XOR of the bits at positions 4 and 0, and the remaining bits shift accordingly.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through 2^5-1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximum-length LFSR.'}
