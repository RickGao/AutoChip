The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, and a synchronous active-high reset that initializes the LFSR output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implementation follows the specification:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal or the positive edge of the `reset` signal.
2. If `reset` is high, the register `q` is initialized to `5'b00001`, which sets the LFSR output to 1.
3. If `reset` is low, the LFSR operation is performed:
   - The new most significant bit `q[4]` is calculated by XORing the bits at positions 3 and 0 (the taps at 5 and 3).
   - The remaining bits `q[3:0]` are shifted one position to the left, effectively shifting the LFSR.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
