{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

The completed Verilog module for the given specification is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` which is a 5-bit register to hold the LFSR output.
2. In the `always` block, the LFSR is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal or when the reset is high.
3. If the reset is high, the LFSR output `q` is initialized to 5'b00001.
4. If the reset is low, the LFSR is updated:
   - The bits of `q` are shifted left by one position, effectively shifting the bits to the left by one position.
   - The new least significant bit `q[0]` is calculated as the XOR of the most significant bit `q[4]` and the bit at position 2 `q[2]`, which corresponds to the taps at positions 5 and 3 as specified in the problem.
5. This arrangement ensures that the 5-bit LFSR produces a maximum-length sequence of 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required.'}
