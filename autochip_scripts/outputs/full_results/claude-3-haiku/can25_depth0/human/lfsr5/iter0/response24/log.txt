The provided Verilog module specification describes a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR should have a synchronous active-high reset that resets the output to 1.

The corrected Verilog module implementation is as follows:

1. The module has two input ports: `clk` for the clock signal and `reset` for the active-high synchronous reset signal.
2. The module has one output port: `q`, a 5-bit register that holds the LFSR output.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal or the positive edge of the reset signal.
4. If the `reset` signal is high, the LFSR output `q` is set to `5'b00001`, which is the initial state of the LFSR.
5. If the `reset` signal is low, the LFSR is updated by shifting the bits to the right and computing the new value for the least significant bit `q[0]` using the XOR of `q[4]` and `q[2]`, which corresponds to the taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

This implementation ensures that the 5-bit LFSR cycles through 2^5-1 = 31 states before repeating, as required for a maximum-length LFSR.'}
