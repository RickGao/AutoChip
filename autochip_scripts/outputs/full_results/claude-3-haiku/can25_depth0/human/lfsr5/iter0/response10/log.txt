This Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR output is stored in the `q` register, and the active-high synchronous reset sets the LFSR output to 1.

The `always` block handles the LFSR update logic:

1. If the `reset` signal is active, the LFSR output `q` is set to `5'b1` to initialize the LFSR.
2. If the `reset` signal is not active, the LFSR is updated:
   - The bits in `q[4:1]` are shifted one position to the right, effectively shifting the LFSR.
   - The new bit in `q[0]` is generated by XORing the bits at positions 5 (`q[4]`) and 3 (`q[2]`) of the LFSR.

This configuration of the Galois LFSR with the chosen tap positions ensures that the LFSR will cycle through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
