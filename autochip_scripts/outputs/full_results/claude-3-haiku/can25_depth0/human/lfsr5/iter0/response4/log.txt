{'role': 'user', 'content': '// A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

The provided Verilog code for a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3 is correct and should compile without any errors. The module has the following functionality:

1. The `q` register is a 5-bit wide register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
2. In the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the `q` register is set to `5'b1`, which is the initial state of the LFSR.
   - If the `reset` input is low, the LFSR shifts the bits to the right by one position, and the new least significant bit (`q[0]`) is computed as the XOR of the most significant bit (`q[4]`) and the bit at position 2 (`q[2]`), which corresponds to the taps at positions 5 and 3.

This implementation ensures that the LFSR cycles through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, as required for a maximal-length LFSR.'}
