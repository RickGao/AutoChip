This Verilog module implements the specified Moore state machine. The key points are:

1. The state is represented by a register `state` with two states: `OFF` and `ON`.
2. The output `out` is assigned based on the current state.
3. The state transitions are controlled by the input signals `j` and `k` as per the given state machine diagram.
4. The asynchronous reset `areset` sets the state to `OFF` and the output `out` to 0.
5. The state transitions are handled in a `case` statement inside the `always` block which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the asynchronous reset.'}
