The provided Verilog module specification describes a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output. The state machine has the following behavior:

1. **OFF** state:
   - If `j = 0`, the state remains in **OFF**.
   - If `j = 1`, the state transitions to **ON**.
   - The output `out` is 0 in this state.

2. **ON** state:
   - If `k = 0`, the state remains in **ON**.
   - If `k = 1`, the state transitions to **OFF**.
   - The output `out` is 1 in this state.

The reset signal `areset` is an active-high asynchronous reset that resets the state machine to the **OFF** state.

The completed Verilog module above implements the specified state machine. It includes the following key components:

1. State variables: `state` and `next_state` to keep track of the current and next state.
2. State transition logic: The `always @(*)` block handles the state transitions based on the input conditions.
3. Output logic: The output `out` is directly assigned the current state `state`.
4. State register: The `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block updates the state register based on the next state and the asynchronous reset signal.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the specified Moore state machine.'}
