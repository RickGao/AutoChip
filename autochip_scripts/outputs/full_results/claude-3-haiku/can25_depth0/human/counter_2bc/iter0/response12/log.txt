This Verilog module implements a two-bit saturating counter with the following behavior:

1. The counter is reset to 2'b01 (weakly not-taken) on a positive edge of the `areset` signal.
2. When `train_valid` is 1, the counter is updated:
   - If `train_taken` is 1, the counter is incremented up to a maximum value of 3.
   - If `train_taken` is 0, the counter is decremented down to a minimum value of 0.
3. When `train_valid` is 0, the counter keeps its current value.
4. The two-bit counter value is output through the `state` port.

This module should compile and function correctly based on the provided specification.'}
