{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

```

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem specification. The module has the following components:

1. A buffer to store the 3 bytes of the received message.
2. A state variable to keep track of the current state of the FSM.
3. A count variable to keep track of the number of bytes received.
4. A message variable to store the final 24-bit message.

The FSM operates as follows:

1. In the initial state (state 0), the module is searching for the start byte (when `in[3]` is 1).
2. Once the start byte is detected, the module transitions to the receiving state (state 1) and stores the first byte in the buffer.
3. In the receiving state, the module continues to store the incoming bytes in the buffer until all 3 bytes have been received.
4. When all 3 bytes have been received, the module transitions to the done state (state 2) and asserts the `done` signal.
5. In the done state, the module updates the `out_bytes` output with the assembled 24-bit message.
6. On the next clock cycle, the module transitions back to the initial state (state 0) and begins searching for the next start byte.

The module also handles the synchronous reset signal, which resets the state, count, and message variables to their initial values.'}
