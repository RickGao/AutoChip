{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

The module above implements the given Verilog specification. It uses a single always block to handle the state transitions and update the internal registers based on the input `in[7:0]` and the `reset` signal.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `byte_count` register tracks the number of bytes received for the current message. It is reset to 0 when `reset` is high or when a complete message (3 bytes) has been received.
2. The `message` register stores the 24-bit message being assembled. The bytes are stored in the appropriate positions based on the `byte_count`.
3. The `message_received` flag is set to 1 when the third byte of a message has been received, and is reset to 0 when a new message starts.
4. The `out_bytes` output is directly connected to the `message` register, and the `done` output is connected to the `message_received` flag.

The module correctly handles the input byte stream and the provided waveform example.'}
