{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as a 512-cell system. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes four inputs: `clk` (clock), `load` (synchronous active high load input), `data` (the initial state of the cells), and outputs `q` (the current state of the cells).

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. If the `load` input is high, the current state of the cells (`q`) is updated with the new `data` input.

4. If the `load` input is low, the next state of the cells is calculated based on the Rule 110 logic:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on its own value and the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The middle cells `q[1]` to `q[510]` are updated based on the values of the previous and next cells.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is updated based on the value of the second-to-last cell `q[510]` and a constant value of 0 (assuming the boundary condition is 0).

This implementation correctly advances the 512-cell system by one time step each clock cycle, as per the given specification.'}
