{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. The module has the following features:

1. The `top_module` has three inputs: `clk` (clock), `load` (synchronous active high load input), and `data` (512-bit input data).
2. The module has one output: `q` (512-bit output data).
3. The `always` block runs on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` input is high, the module loads the `data` input into the `q` output.
5. If the `load` input is low, the module updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton.
6. The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are updated based on the boundary conditions, where the left and right neighbors (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are assumed to be zero (off).
7. The middle cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`) are updated based on the Rule 110 logic: `q[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1] ^ q[i]`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system.'}
