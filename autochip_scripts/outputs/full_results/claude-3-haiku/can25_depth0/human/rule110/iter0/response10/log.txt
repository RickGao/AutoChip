{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (a synchronous active-high load input), and `data` (a 512-bit input representing the initial state of the cells).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 512-bit register that stores the current state of the cells.
3. In the always block, the code checks the value of the `load` input:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new data from `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the code updates the state of each cell based on the Rule 110 logic:
     - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are updated based on the values of their two neighbors.
     - For the remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the new state is determined by the values of the current cell and its two neighbors.
4. The boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512]) are assumed to be both zero (off).

This Verilog code correctly implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system.'}
