{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as specified. The key aspects are:

1. The module has a 512-bit wide `q` register to represent the state of the 512 cells.
2. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the cells from the `data` input.
3. The `always` block updates the state of the cells on every clock cycle, following the Rule 110 transition rules.
   - The first and last cells are handled separately, as their neighbors are assumed to be always off (0).
   - The remaining cells are updated using the Rule 110 transition logic.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the specified Rule 110 cellular automaton.'}
