{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. Here's how it works:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (a synchronous active high load input), and `data` (a 512-bit input that represents the initial state of the 512-cell system).
2. The module has one output: `q`, which is a 512-bit register that holds the current state of the 512-cell system.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `load` input is high, the current state of the 512-cell system (`q`) is updated with the `data` input.
5. If the `load` input is low, the next state of the 512-cell system is computed according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The rule is implemented using a `for` loop that iterates through the 512 cells, with the boundary conditions (cells at indices 0 and 511) handled separately.
6. The next state of each cell is computed based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors, following the Rule 110 transition rules as described in the problem statement.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton system.'}
