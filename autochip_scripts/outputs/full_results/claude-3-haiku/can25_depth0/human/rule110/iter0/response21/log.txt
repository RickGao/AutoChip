{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The module implements the rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The `q` register holds the current state of the 512-cell system, and the `always` block updates the state of each cell based on the state of the cell and its two neighbors, according to the rule 110 transition table.

The `load` input allows the initial state of the system to be loaded from the `data` input. If `load` is not asserted, the module computes the next state of the system on each clock cycle.

The boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512]) are both assumed to be 0 (off), as specified in the problem statement.'}
