{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as a 512-cell system. The `top_module` has the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: A clock signal that advances the state of the cellular automaton by one time step on each positive edge.
- `load`: A synchronous active high input that loads the state of the system from the `data` input.
- `data`: A 512-bit input that holds the initial state of the cellular automaton.
- `q`: A 512-bit output that holds the current state of the cellular automaton.

The `always` block inside the module handles the logic for advancing the state of the cellular automaton. When the `load` input is high, the current state is loaded from the `data` input. When the `load` input is low, the state of the cellular automaton is advanced by one time step, where the next state of each cell is determined by the current state of the cell itself and its two neighbors, according to the Rule 110 logic.

The boundary conditions (the values of `q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are assumed to be zero (off), as per the problem statement.'}
