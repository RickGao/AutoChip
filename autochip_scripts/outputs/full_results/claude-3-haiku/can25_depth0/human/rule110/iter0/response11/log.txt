{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

```verilog
module top_module(

    always @(posedge clk) begin

        end
    end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `load` to load the initial state, an input `data[511:0]` for the initial state, and an output `q[511:0]` for the current state.
2. On each clock cycle, if `load` is high, the module simply loads the `data` into `q`.
3. If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of each cell based on the Rule 110 cellular automaton rules.
   - The first and last cells are handled separately, as their neighbors are assumed to be 0.
   - For the internal cells, the next state is computed based on the current state and its two neighbors.

This implementation advances the 512-cell system by one time step per clock cycle, as required.'}
