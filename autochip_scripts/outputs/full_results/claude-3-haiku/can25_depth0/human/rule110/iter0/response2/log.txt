{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` takes in the following ports:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `load`: The synchronous active high load input.
   - `data`: A 512-bit input representing the initial state of the cellular automaton.
   - `q`: A 512-bit output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the input `data`.
4. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of the cellular automaton is computed using the Rule 110 logic:
   - The rightmost bit `q[511]` is set to the value of the second-to-rightmost bit `q[510]`.
   - The remaining bits `q[510:1]` are updated based on the Rule 110 logic, which depends on the current cell and its two neighbors.
   - The leftmost bit `q[0]` is set to the value of the second-to-leftmost bit `q[1]`.

This implementation assumes that the boundary conditions (the values of `q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are both zero (off), as specified in the problem statement.'}
