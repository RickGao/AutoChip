This Verilog module creates 16 D-flip-flops with the following functionality:

1. The `clk` input is the clock signal, and the flip-flops are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The `resetn` input is an active-low synchronous reset. When `resetn` is low, all the flip-flop outputs `q` are set to 0.
3. The `byteena` input is a 2-bit signal that controls which bytes of the 16-bit input `d` are written to the corresponding bytes of the 16-bit output `q`. `byteena[0]` controls the lower byte of `q` (bits 7:0), and `byteena[1]` controls the upper byte of `q` (bits 15:8).
4. The `d` input is the 16-bit data to be written to the flip-flops.
5. The `q` output is the current state of the 16 flip-flops.

The `always` block handles the logic for the flip-flops. On the positive edge of `clk`, if `resetn` is low, all the flip-flop outputs `q` are set to 0. Otherwise, the flip-flop outputs are updated based on the `byteena` signals. If `byteena[0]` is high, the lower byte of `q` is updated with the lower byte of `d`. If `byteena[1]` is high, the upper byte of `q` is updated with the upper byte of `d`.'}
