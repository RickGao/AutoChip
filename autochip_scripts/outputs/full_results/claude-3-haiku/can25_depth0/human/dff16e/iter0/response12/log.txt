The provided Verilog module specification is correct and this implementation addresses the requirements. The key points are:

1. The module has 16 D flip-flops, represented by the 16-bit output `q`.
2. The `resetn` input is a synchronous, active-low reset that sets all the flip-flops to 0 when asserted.
3. The `byteena` input is a 2-bit signal that controls which bytes of the 16-bit `d` input are written to the corresponding bytes of the `q` output.
4. The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` input.
5. Inside the `always` block, the module first checks the `resetn` input. If it is low (active), all the flip-flops are set to 0.
6. If `resetn` is high (inactive), the module checks the `byteena` bits to determine which bytes of `d` should be written to the corresponding bytes of `q`.

This implementation should correctly implement the specified 16-bit D flip-flop module with byte-enable functionality and synchronous reset.'}
