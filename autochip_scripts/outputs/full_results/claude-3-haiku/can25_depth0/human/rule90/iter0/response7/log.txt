This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem specification. The `top_module` has the following ports:

- `clk`: The clock input.
- `load`: If `load` is high, the state of the system (`q[511:0]`) is loaded with the `data[511:0]` input.
- `data[511:0]`: The input data to be loaded into the system when `load` is high.
- `q[511:0]`: The output that represents the state of the 512-cell system.

The module uses an `always` block to update the state of the system on each clock cycle. If `load` is high, the state is simply loaded with the `data` input. Otherwise, the module updates the state based on the Rule 90 cellular automaton rules. The boundary cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are set to 0, and the remaining cells are updated by taking the XOR of their left and right neighbors.'}
