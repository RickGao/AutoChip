{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described. The key aspects are:

1. The module has a 512-bit output `q` that represents the state of the cellular automaton.
2. On the positive edge of the clock, the module checks the `load` input:
   - If `load` is high, the module loads the state from the `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton by applying the Rule 90 logic.
3. The Rule 90 logic is implemented using a loop that iterates through the internal cells (1 to 510) and computes the next state of each cell as the XOR of its left and right neighbors.
4. The boundary conditions are handled separately, with the first cell `q[0]` taking the value of `q[1]`, and the last cell `q[511]` being set to 0 (off).

This implementation should correctly implement the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described.'}
