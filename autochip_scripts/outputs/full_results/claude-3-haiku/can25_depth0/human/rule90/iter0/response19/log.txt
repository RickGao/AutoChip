This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described. The `top_module` takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and a 512-bit input data `data`. The output `q` is a 512-bit register that stores the current state of the cellular automaton.

When the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the input data `data`. When the `load` signal is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton by applying the Rule 90 logic to each cell.

The first and last cells are handled separately, as the problem statement specifies that the boundary conditions are both set to 0. The rest of the cells are updated based on the XOR of their left and right neighbors.

The module uses a `for` loop to iterate through the cells and update their states accordingly.'}
