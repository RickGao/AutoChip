{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle.

This Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. It has the following features:

1. The module has four ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input
   - `load`: A control signal to load the initial state of the 512-cell system
   - `data`: A 512-bit input vector that holds the initial state to be loaded
   - `q`: A 512-bit output vector that holds the current state of the 512-cell system

2. The module uses an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the new state from the `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the 512-cell system by applying the Rule 90 cellular automaton rules:
     - The boundary cells `q[0]` and `q[511]` are set to 0 (off).
     - For the remaining cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is computed as the XOR of the current state of the left and right neighbors.

This implementation correctly handles the 512-cell system and the boundary conditions as specified in the problem statement.'}
