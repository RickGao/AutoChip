{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle.

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and a 512-bit input data `data`. It outputs a 512-bit signal `q` representing the state of the cellular automaton.

2. Inside the always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal, the module checks the `load` signal:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the input `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of the cellular automaton:
     - The first cell `q[0]` is assigned the value of the second cell `q[1]`, as per the boundary condition.
     - The last cell `q[511]` is assigned the value 0, as per the boundary condition.
     - For the rest of the cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is computed as the XOR of the left and right neighbors, as per the Rule 90 specification.

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell cellular automaton based on the Rule 90 specification, with the appropriate boundary conditions.'}
