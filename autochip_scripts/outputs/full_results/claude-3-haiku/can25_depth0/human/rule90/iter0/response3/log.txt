{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, a 512-bit input data `data`, and outputs a 512-bit state `q`.
2. In the `always` block, the module checks if the `load` signal is high. If it is, the module loads the input data `data` into the state `q`.
3. If the `load` signal is low, the module updates the state `q` as follows:
   - The first bit `q[0]` is updated to the value of `q[1]`, the second bit.
   - The last bit `q[511]` is set to 0, assuming the boundary condition is 0.
   - For the rest of the bits `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is computed as the XOR of the current bit and the next bit, implementing the Rule 90 cellular automaton.
4. The module updates the state `q` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton as specified in the problem statement.'}
