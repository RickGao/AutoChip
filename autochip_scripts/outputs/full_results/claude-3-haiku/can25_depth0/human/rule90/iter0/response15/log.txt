{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as specified. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `load` to indicate when the initial state should be loaded, an input `data[511:0]` for the initial state, and an output `q[511:0]` for the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.

3. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the provided `data`.

4. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of the cellular automaton is computed. The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are handled separately, with the boundary conditions set to 0. For the internal cells, the next state is computed as the XOR of the current cell and its two neighbors.

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton on each clock cycle, assuming the initial state is provided through the `data` input.'}
