The module has been corrected to implement the 12-hour clock functionality as specified. The key changes are:

1. The initial values for `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` are set to 12:00 AM when `reset` is asserted.
2. The seconds, minutes, and hours are incremented correctly based on the `ena` signal, handling the rollover from 59 seconds to 0, 59 minutes to 0, and 12 AM to 1 AM (or PM).
3. The `pm` signal is updated appropriately to indicate whether the current time is AM or PM.'}
