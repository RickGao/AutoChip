The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. Here's how it works:

1. The `reset` signal has the highest priority and resets the clock to `12:00 AM` when asserted.
2. When the `ena` signal is asserted, the module increments the seconds, minutes, and hours accordingly.
3. The seconds are incremented until they reach 59, at which point the minutes are incremented, and the seconds reset to 00.
4. The minutes are incremented until they reach 59, at which point the hours are incremented, and the minutes reset to 00.
5. The hours are incremented until they reach 12, at which point the AM/PM indicator (`pm`) is toggled, and the hours reset to 01.
6. The BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) representation of the hours, minutes, and seconds are stored in the `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` registers, respectively.

This module should correctly implement the 12-hour clock functionality as specified in the problem statement.'}
