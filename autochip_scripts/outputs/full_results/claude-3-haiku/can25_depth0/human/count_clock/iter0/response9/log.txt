The completed Verilog module for the given specification includes the following:

1. A reset signal that synchronously resets the clock to "12:00 AM" when asserted.
2. An enable signal (ena) that triggers the clock to increment once per second.
3. Separate 8-bit registers for hours (hh), minutes (mm), and seconds (ss) to represent the time in BCD format.
4. A flag (pm) that indicates whether the time is AM (0) or PM (1).
5. The clock logic that increments the seconds, minutes, and hours accordingly, and updates the AM/PM flag when necessary.

The module correctly handles the specified requirements for a 12-hour clock with am/pm indicator.'}
