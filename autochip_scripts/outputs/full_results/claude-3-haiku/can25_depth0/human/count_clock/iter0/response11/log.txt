The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The key features are:

1. The module is clocked by the `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal is used to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second).
2. The `reset` signal has higher priority than `ena` and can reset the clock to "12:00 AM" at any time.
3. The `pm` signal is used to indicate whether the current time is AM (0) or PM (1).
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format, respectively.
5. The module correctly handles the rollover of seconds, minutes, and hours, as well as the transition between AM and PM.

This Verilog module should compile and function as expected.'}
