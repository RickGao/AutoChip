The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. The module uses three 8-bit registers to store the hours, minutes, and seconds, and a single bit register to store the AM/PM indicator.

The module has the following functionality:

1. On reset, the clock is set to 12:00 AM.
2. The seconds counter is incremented on every ena pulse, up to a maximum of 59.
3. When the seconds counter reaches 59, it resets to 0 and the minutes counter is incremented.
4. When the minutes counter reaches 59, it resets to 0 and the hours counter is incremented.
5. When the hours counter reaches 12, it resets to 1 and the AM/PM indicator is toggled.

The module ensures that the clock wraps around properly and maintains the correct AM/PM indication.'}
