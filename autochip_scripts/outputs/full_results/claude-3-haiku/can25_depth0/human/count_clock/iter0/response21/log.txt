This Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The clock is clocked by the `clk` input, and the `ena` input is used to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second). The `reset` input is used to reset the clock to 12:00 AM. The outputs `pm`, `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` represent the AM/PM indicator and the current time in BCD format.

The module initializes the clock to 12:00 AM in the `initial` block. The `always` block handles the clock updates. When `reset` is asserted, the clock is reset to 12:00 AM. When `ena` is asserted, the seconds, minutes, and hours are incremented as appropriate, and the AM/PM indicator is updated when the hours reach 13.'}
