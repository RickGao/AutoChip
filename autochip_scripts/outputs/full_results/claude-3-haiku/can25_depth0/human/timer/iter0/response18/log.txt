{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed. A good way to implement this is with a down-counter that asserts an output signal when the count becomes 0.

The counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. \n// (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk, \n\tinput load, \n\tinput [9:0] data, \n\toutput tc\n);'}

The key changes made to the original code are:

1. Declared the `counter` register as a 10-bit register to hold the countdown value.
2. Used a single `always` block to handle both the load and decrement logic.
3. Assigned the `tc` output signal based on the value of the `counter` register.
4. Cleared the `tc` signal when the `load` signal is asserted, to ensure the signal is properly deasserted when a new countdown value is loaded.

This implementation ensures that the timer correctly loads the given countdown value, decrements the counter on each clock cycle, and asserts the `tc` signal when the countdown reaches 0.'}
