The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `counter` register as a 10-bit wide register to match the input `data` signal.
2. Used a single `always` block to handle the load and decrement logic for the counter.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If `load` is asserted, the `counter` is loaded with the `data` value, and the `tc` signal is cleared.
   - If `load` is not asserted, the module checks if the `counter` is greater than 0. If so, it decrements the `counter` and keeps the `tc` signal deasserted.
   - If the `counter` reaches 0, the `tc` signal is asserted.

The module now correctly implements the timer functionality as per the given specification.'}
