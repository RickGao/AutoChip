{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed. A good way to implement this is with a down-counter that asserts an output signal when the count becomes 0.

The counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. \n// (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk, \n\tinput load, \n\tinput [9:0] data, \n\toutput tc\n);'}

The key points in the corrected module are:

1. Declare a 10-bit `counter` register to store the countdown value.
2. Use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
3. Inside the block:
   - If `load` is high, load the `data` into the `counter` and reset the `tc` signal.
   - If `load` is low, decrement the `counter` if it is greater than 0, and set the `tc` signal when the `counter` reaches 0.
4. The `tc` signal is a registered output that reflects the state of the countdown.

This module should correctly implement the timer functionality as described in the specification.'}
