{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed. A good way to implement this is with a down-counter that asserts an output signal when the count becomes 0.

The counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. \n// (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk, \n\tinput load, \n\tinput [9:0] data, \n\toutput tc\n);'}

The completed Verilog module implements the desired timer functionality as described in the specification. The key points are:

1. The `counter` register stores the current value of the countdown timer.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If `load` is 1, the `counter` is loaded with the `data` value, and the `tc` output is reset to 0.
4. If `load` is 0, the `counter` is decremented if it is not already 0. If the `counter` reaches 0, the `tc` output is set to 1 to indicate that the timer has elapsed.

This module correctly implements the specified timer functionality.'}
