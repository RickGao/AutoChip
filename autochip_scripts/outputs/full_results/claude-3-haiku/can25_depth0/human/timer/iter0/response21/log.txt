This Verilog module implements a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, and then asserts the `tc` signal to indicate that the timer has reached zero. The module has the following behavior:

1. If `load` is 1, the internal `counter` register is loaded with the value in the `data` input, and the `tc` output is set to 0.
2. If `load` is 0 and the `counter` is not zero, the `counter` is decremented by 1, and the `tc` output is set to 1 when the `counter` reaches 1.
3. If the `counter` reaches 0, the `tc` output is set to 1 and stays at 1 until the `counter` is loaded again.

The module uses a single always block to handle the timer logic. The `counter` register is updated on each clock cycle based on the `load` input, and the `tc` output is set accordingly.'}
