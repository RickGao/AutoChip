The logic for the outputs Y1 and Y3 is derived by inspecting the state transition diagram and the one-hot encoding of the states.

For Y1:
- From state A (y[0]), the next state is B (y[1]) on input 1, so the term (y[0] & y[1]) is included.
- From state B (y[1]), the next state is D (y[3]) on input 0, so the term (y[1] & y[3]) is included.
- From state C (y[2]), the next state is E (y[5]) on input 1, so the term (y[2] & y[5]) is included.

For Y3:
- From state A (y[0]), the next state is D (y[3]) on input 0, so the term (y[0] & y[3]) is included.
- From state B (y[1]), the next state is C (y[2]) on input 1, so the term (y[1] & y[2]) is included.
- From state D (y[3]), the next state is A (y[0]) on input 0, so the term (y[3] & ~w) is included.
- From state E (y[4]), the next state is E (y[4]) on input 1, and the next state is D (y[3]) on input 0, so the term (y[4] & w) | (y[4] & ~w) is simplified to (y[4] & w).
- From state F (y[5]), the next state is C (y[2]) on input 1, so the term (y[5] & y[2]) is included.'}
