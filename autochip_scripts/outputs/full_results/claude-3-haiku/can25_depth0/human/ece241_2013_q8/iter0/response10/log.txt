The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, and it uses 3 states to recognize the sequence.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that if the input sequence is "1011010", the output `z` will be asserted for both the first and second occurrences of "101".

The `state` register holds the current state of the FSM, and the `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`. The `always` block with the `posedge clk, negedge aresetn` condition updates the `state` register based on the `next_state` logic.

The `always` block with the `(*)` sensitivity list implements the combinational logic for the next state and output `z`. The `case` statement checks the current state and updates the `next_state` and `z` output accordingly.'}
