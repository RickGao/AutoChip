The module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The module has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, and it has 3 states.

The module recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning that if the input sequence is "10101", the output `z` will be asserted twice, once for the first "101" sequence and once for the second "101" sequence.'}
