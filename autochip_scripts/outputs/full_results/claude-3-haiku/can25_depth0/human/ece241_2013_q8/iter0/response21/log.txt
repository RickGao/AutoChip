The completed Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has three states and recognizes overlapping sequences.'}
