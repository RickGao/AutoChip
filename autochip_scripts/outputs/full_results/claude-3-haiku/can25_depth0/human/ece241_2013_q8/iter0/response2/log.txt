The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses 3 states.

The `always` block that updates the state on the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of the `aresetn` reset signal. The `always` block that determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x` signal.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences by transitioning to the appropriate state based on the current state and the input signal. When the sequence "101" is detected, the output `z` is asserted to logic-1.'}
