The provided Verilog module correctly implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The module has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and only uses 3 states.

The module correctly handles overlapping sequences by transitioning to the appropriate state based on the current input `x`. The state transitions and output logic are defined in the `always @(*)` block, which ensures that the FSM reacts to the input immediately.'}
