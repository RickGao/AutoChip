The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and uses 3 states to recognize the sequence.

The module uses a `state` register to track the current state and a `next_state` register to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `x`. The `always` block with the `posedge clk` and `negedge aresetn` conditions updates the `state` register based on the `next_state` value.

The combinational logic in the second `always` block determines the `next_state` and the output `z` based on the current `state` and the input `x`. The module recognizes overlapping sequences by maintaining the correct state transitions.'}
