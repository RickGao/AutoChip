The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states (S0, S1, and S2) and an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected.

The state transitions are as follows:
- The initial state is S0. If the current input `x` is 1, the next state is S1. Otherwise, the next state remains S0.
- In state S1, if the current input `x` is 0, the next state is S0. If the current input `x` is 1, the next state is S2.
- In state S2, if the current input `x` is 1, the next state is S1. If the current input `x` is 0, the next state is S0. In this state, the output `z` is asserted to 1.

The module also includes a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, where the state machine is reset to the initial state S0 when the `aresetn` signal is low.'}
