The provided Verilog module is correct and implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected, and a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset `aresetn`.

The module has three states:
1. `IDLE`: The initial state, where the machine waits for the first '1' in the sequence.
2. `FIRST_1`: The state where the first '1' in the sequence has been detected.
3. `DETECTED`: The state where the complete "101" sequence has been detected.

The module correctly handles overlapping sequences and updates the `z` output accordingly.'}
