{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the Lemmings game behavior as described in the problem statement. The module has two input signals (`bump_left` and `bump_right`) that indicate when the Lemming hits an obstacle on the left or right side, respectively. The module has two output signals (`walk_left` and `walk_right`) that indicate the direction the Lemming is currently walking.

The module has two states:
1. `STATE_WALK_LEFT`: The Lemming is walking towards the left.
2. `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`: The Lemming is walking towards the right.

The state transition logic is as follows:
- If the Lemming is walking left (`STATE_WALK_LEFT`) and it is bumped on the right (`bump_right`), it will switch to walking right (`STATE_WALK_RIGHT`).
- If the Lemming is walking right (`STATE_WALK_RIGHT`) and it is bumped on the left (`bump_left`), it will switch to walking left (`STATE_WALK_LEFT`).

The `areset` signal is a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that resets the Lemming to walk left.'}
