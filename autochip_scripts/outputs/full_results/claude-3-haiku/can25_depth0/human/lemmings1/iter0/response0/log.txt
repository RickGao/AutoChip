{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the described Lemmings state machine behavior. It has the following features:

1. The module has two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`, represented by the `state` register.
2. The module has two input signals: `bump_left` and `bump_right`, which indicate when the Lemming is bumped from the left or right, respectively.
3. The module has two output signals: `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which indicate the Lemming's current direction.
4. The `always` block handles the state transition and output logic. It is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal or the `areset` signal.
5. When `areset` is high, the module is reset to the `WALK_LEFT` state, and the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set accordingly.
6. During normal operation, the module transitions between the `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT` states based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs.
7. The output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` are updated based on the current state.

This Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings state machine behavior as described in the problem statement.'}
