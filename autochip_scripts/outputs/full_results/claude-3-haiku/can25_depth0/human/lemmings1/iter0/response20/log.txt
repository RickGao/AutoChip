{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings state machine behavior as described. The module uses a single register `state` to track the current state of the Lemming (walking left or walking right). The `always` block handles the state transition logic based on the input signals `bump_left` and `bump_right`. The module also provides the output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` to indicate the Lemming's current direction.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The use of a localparam to define the two possible states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`.
2. The `always` block that handles the state transitions and updates the output signals accordingly.
3. The asynchronous reset logic that sets the initial state to `LEFT` and the corresponding output signals.
4. The default case in the `case` statement to handle any unspecified state.

This module should compile and function as per the given specification.'}
