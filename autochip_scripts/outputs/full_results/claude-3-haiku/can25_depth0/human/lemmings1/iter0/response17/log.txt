{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module specification describes a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The module has two inputs (`bump_left` and `bump_right`) and two outputs (`walk_left` and `walk_right`). The module has two states: walking left (LEFT) and walking right (RIGHT).

The module uses a single register `state` to keep track of the current state of the Lemming. The `always` block updates the state and outputs based on the current state and the input signals. When the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high, the module resets the state to `LEFT` and sets the `walk_left` output to 1 and the `walk_right` output to 0.

In the `LEFT` state, the module sets the `walk_left` output to 1 and the `walk_right` output to 0. If the `bump_left` or `bump_right` input is high, the module transitions to the `RIGHT` state.

In the `RIGHT` state, the module sets the `walk_left` output to 0 and the `walk_right` output to 1. If the `bump_left` or `bump_right` input is high, the module transitions to the `LEFT` state.

The module correctly implements the behavior described in the specification.'}
