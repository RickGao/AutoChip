{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The machine has two states: "walk left" (LEFT) and "walk right" (RIGHT). The inputs are `bump_left` and `bump_right`, which indicate when the Lemming hits an obstacle on the left or right side, respectively. The outputs are `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which indicate the Lemming's current direction of movement.

The state machine operates as follows:

1. If the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high, the machine is reset to the "walk left" state, with `walk_left` set to 1 and `walk_right` set to 0.
2. In the "walk left" state, the machine sets `walk_left` to 1 and `walk_right` to 0. If the `bump_right` input is 1, indicating that the Lemming has hit an obstacle on the right side, the machine transitions to the "walk right" state.
3. In the "walk right" state, the machine sets `walk_left` to 0 and `walk_right` to 1. If the `bump_left` input is 1, indicating that the Lemming has hit an obstacle on the left side, the machine transitions to the "walk left" state.

The state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.'}
