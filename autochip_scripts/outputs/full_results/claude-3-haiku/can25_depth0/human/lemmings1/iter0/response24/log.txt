{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings game behavior using a Moore state machine. The key aspects are:

1. The module has two states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the Lemming's walking direction.
2. The module has two outputs, `walk_left` and `walk_right`, which are set based on the current state.
3. The module updates the state based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs, switching the direction when a bump is detected.
4. The `areset` input is used to asynchronously reset the module to the `LEFT` state.
5. The state updates and output assignments are made within a single `always` block, which is sensitive to the `clk` and `areset` inputs.

This module should correctly model the desired Lemmings game behavior.'}
