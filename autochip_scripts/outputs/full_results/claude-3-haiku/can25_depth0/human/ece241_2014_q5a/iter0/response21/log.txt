This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits representing the number to be converted, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.

The module has three main states: `IDLE`, `COMPUTE`, and `DONE`. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the reset to be released. Once the reset is released, the module enters the `COMPUTE` state, where it shifts the input bits into the `complement` register and updates the `z` output with the most significant bit of the complement. The module remains in the `COMPUTE` state until all the input bits have been processed, at which point it enters the `DONE` state.

The datapath logic handles the shifting of the input bits, the computation of the 2's complement, and the output of the result. The state transition logic determines the next state based on the current state and the reset signal.

Overall, this module correctly implements the specified one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine.'}
