The provided Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.

The module has the following features:

1. Positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset using the `areset` signal.
2. The conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.
3. The module has three states: `IDLE`, `CALC`, and `DONE`.
4. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the input to become active (`x` is 1).
5. In the `CALC` state, the module shifts the input bits into the `input_reg` and calculates the 2's complement of the input, storing it in the `complement` register.
6. In the `DONE` state, the module outputs the 2's complement of the input.
7. The output `z` is only valid when the state is `DONE`.

The module correctly implements the given specification and should be able to handle input numbers of arbitrary length.'}
