The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset. The conversion begins when Reset is released and stops when Reset is asserted.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput x,\n\toutput z\n);"}

This module implements the serial 2's complementer state machine as specified. The key features are:

1. The state machine has three states: IDLE, CONVERT, and DONE.
2. The `accumulator` register stores the input bits as they are shifted in.
3. The `bit_count` register keeps track of the number of bits received.
4. When all 8 bits have been received, the 2's complement is computed and stored in the `z` output.
5. The state machine transitions back to IDLE when the `areset` signal is asserted.

The module should correctly handle the serial input and produce the 2's complement output as specified.'}
