The module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine accepts input numbers of arbitrary length and the conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.

The module has three states:
1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the machine waits for `areset` to be released.
2. `CONVERT`: The state where the input bits are shifted into `input_num`, the 2's complement is calculated, and the output `z` is updated.
3. `COMPLETE`: The state where the output `z` is set to 0 after the conversion is complete.

The module uses a `for` loop to shift the bits in `input_num` and calculates the 2's complement by negating `input_num` and adding 1. The output `z` is set to the least-significant bit of the 2's complement.'}
