The completed Verilog module implements a 2's complement state machine that takes a series of bits (one per clock cycle) as input, and outputs the 2's complement of the input. The module has two states: `STATE_INIT` and `STATE_COMP`.

In the `STATE_INIT` state, the module collects the input bits and stores them in the `num` register. When the input is complete (after 8 bits), the module transitions to the `STATE_COMP` state.

In the `STATE_COMP` state, the module computes the 2's complement of the input stored in `num` and outputs the result in the `z` register. After the computation is complete, the module transitions back to the `STATE_INIT` state to accept the next input.

The module also includes an asynchronous reset functionality, where the `areset` input can be used to reset the module to the `STATE_INIT` state and clear the `num` and `z` registers.'}
