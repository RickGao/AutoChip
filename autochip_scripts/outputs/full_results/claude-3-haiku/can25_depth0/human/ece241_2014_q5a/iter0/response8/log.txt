The provided Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The module has the following features:

1. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number.
2. The output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.
3. The circuit requires a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset `areset`.
4. The conversion begins when `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.
5. The module uses a three-state state machine to perform the 2's complement conversion:
   - `WAIT` state: Resets the `sum` register and the output `z`.
   - `COMPUTE` state: Shifts the `sum` register to the left by one bit, appending the current input bit `x`. It then computes the 2's complement output `z` based on the current value of `sum`.
   - `DONE` state: Sets the output `z` to the final 2's complement result.

The module correctly handles the given requirements and should provide the expected functionality.'}
