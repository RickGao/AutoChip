The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. Declared the `state` register as a 2-bit register to represent the three states: `IDLE`, `COMPUTE`, and `DONE`.
2. Initialized the `state` register to `IDLE` and the `z` output to `0` when the asynchronous reset `areset` is asserted.
3. Implemented the state machine logic:
   - In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the input `x` to be 0, and then transitions to the `COMPUTE` state.
   - In the `COMPUTE` state, the module shifts the input `x` into the `num` register and computes the 2's complement of the current value in `num`. If `x` is 1, the 2's complement is output on `z`; otherwise, the original value in `num` is output on `z`. The module stays in the `COMPUTE` state until the asynchronous reset `areset` is asserted, at which point it transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
   - The `DONE` state is not used in this implementation, as the conversion stops when the asynchronous reset `areset` is asserted.

This corrected Verilog module should now correctly implement the one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine.'}
