The provided Verilog module correctly implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses a single `always` block to handle the counter logic. When the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1 on each clock cycle, wrapping around to 0 when it reaches 999.'}
