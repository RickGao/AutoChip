This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block executes on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter value is incremented by 1 and then taken modulo 1000 to keep it within the range of 0 to 999.'}
