The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module addresses all the requirements:

1. The counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles.
2. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.
3. The counter is implemented using a 10-bit register `q` that is updated on the positive edge of the clock.
4. If the reset input is high, the counter is set to 0.
5. If the reset input is low, the counter is incremented by 1, and when it reaches 999, it resets back to 0.

The module is complete and should compile without any errors.'}
