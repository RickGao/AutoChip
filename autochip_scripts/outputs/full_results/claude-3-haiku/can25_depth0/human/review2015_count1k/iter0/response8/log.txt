The provided Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

Here's how the module works:

1. The `q` signal is declared as a 10-bit register to store the counter value.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
3. Inside the `always` block, the counter behavior is defined:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - If the `reset` signal is low, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches its maximum value of 10'b1111111111 (decimal 999), it is reset to 0 on the next clock cycle.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
