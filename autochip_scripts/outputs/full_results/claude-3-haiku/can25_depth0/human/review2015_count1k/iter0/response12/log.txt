The provided Verilog module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the module are:

1. The `q` register is declared as a 10-bit wide output.
2. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the reset condition is checked first. If `reset` is high, `q` is set to 0.
4. If `reset` is not high, the counter is incremented. The counter value is checked to see if it has reached 999 (the maximum value for a 10-bit counter). If so, the counter is reset to 0; otherwise, it is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
