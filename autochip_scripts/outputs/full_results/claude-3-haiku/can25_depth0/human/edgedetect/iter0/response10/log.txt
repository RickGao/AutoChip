The original module specification had no issues, but I've provided the completed Verilog module that implements the desired functionality.

The key points are:

1. Use a register `in_ff1` to capture the previous input value.
2. In the always block, update `in_ff1` with the current input value `in`.
3. Compute the output `pedge` by ANDing the current input `in` with the negation of the previous input `~in_ff1`. This will set the output bit whenever there is a 0 to 1 transition on the corresponding input bit.'}
