The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above.

The key points are:

1. We use a register `in_reg` to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block, we update `in_reg` with the current value of `in` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. We then compute the output `pedge` by taking the bitwise AND of the current `in` and the negated previous `in_reg`. This will set the output bit high only when the corresponding input bit transitions from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the 0 to 1 transitions on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding output bit the cycle after the transition occurs.'}
