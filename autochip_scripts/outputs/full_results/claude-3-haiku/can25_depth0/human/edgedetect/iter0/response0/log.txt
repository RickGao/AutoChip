{'role': 'user', 'content': '// For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to positive edge detection).

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem statement. The key elements are:

1. `in_prev` register to store the previous value of the input signal `in`.
2. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. In the block, the current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev` for the next cycle.
4. The output `pedge` is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` and the negated previous `in_prev`. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit.

The module is complete and should compile without any errors.'}
