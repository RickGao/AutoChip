The provided Verilog module specification is correct. The completed module performs the desired functionality of detecting a positive edge (0 to 1 transition) on each bit of an 8-bit input vector.

The module uses two flip-flops (`in_ff1` and `in_ff2`) to store the current and previous values of the input vector `in`. The `pedge` output is then calculated as the bitwise AND of the current input vector (`in_ff1`) and the negation of the previous input vector (`~in_ff2`), which will result in a high output only for the bits that have transitioned from 0 to 1.'}
