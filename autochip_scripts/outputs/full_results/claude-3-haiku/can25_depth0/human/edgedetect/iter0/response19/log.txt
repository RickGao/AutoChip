The corrected module does the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock `clk`, it:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev`.
   - Calculates the `pedge` output by performing a bitwise AND between the current `in` value and the negated previous `in_prev` value. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit.

This will correctly implement the specified behavior of detecting the 0 to 1 transitions in the 8-bit input vector and generating the output one cycle later.'}
