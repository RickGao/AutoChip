The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality of detecting the positive edge (0 to 1 transition) on each bit of an 8-bit input signal and generating an output signal `pedge` that is set to 1 in the clock cycle after the positive edge is detected.

The key elements of the implementation are:

1. The `in_prev` register stores the previous value of the `in` signal.
2. In the `always @(posedge clk)` block:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in the `in_prev` register.
   - The `pedge` output is calculated as the bitwise AND of the current `in` value and the inverted previous `in_prev` value. This effectively sets the corresponding bit in `pedge` to 1 when the transition from 0 to 1 is detected on the corresponding bit in `in`.

This implementation correctly handles the positive edge detection for each bit of the 8-bit input signal.'}
