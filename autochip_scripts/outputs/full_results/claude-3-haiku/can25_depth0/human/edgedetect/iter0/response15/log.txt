This Verilog module correctly implements the given specification. The `in_reg` register stores the previous value of the `in` input, and the `pedge` output is calculated as the bitwise AND of the current `in` value and the negation of the previous `in_reg` value. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit of the 8-bit vector.'}
