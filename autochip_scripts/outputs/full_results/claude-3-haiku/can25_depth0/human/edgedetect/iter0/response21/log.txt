The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. Added a `reg [7:0] in_prev;` to store the previous input value.
2. Inside the `always` block, the previous input value is stored in `in_prev` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The output `pedge` is assigned the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the negation of the previous input `~in_prev`. This will set the output bit to 1 only when the corresponding bit in the input changes from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the 0 to 1 transitions on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and generates the appropriate output.'}
