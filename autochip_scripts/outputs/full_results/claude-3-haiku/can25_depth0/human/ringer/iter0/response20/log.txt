The corrected Verilog module implements the required functionality. The key changes are:

1. Declared `ringer` and `motor` as `output reg` to make them writable registers.
2. Added an `always` block that evaluates the inputs `ring` and `vibrate_mode` to determine the values of `ringer` and `motor` outputs.
3. If `ring` is high, then the module checks the `vibrate_mode` input:
   - If `vibrate_mode` is high, it sets `ringer` to 0 and `motor` to 1.
   - If `vibrate_mode` is low, it sets `ringer` to 1 and `motor` to 0.
4. If `ring` is low, it sets both `ringer` and `motor` to 0.

This ensures that either the ringer or the motor is activated based on the input conditions, but not both.'}
