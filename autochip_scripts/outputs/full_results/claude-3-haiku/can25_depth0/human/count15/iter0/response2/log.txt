The completed Verilog module correctly implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The key elements of the module are:

1. The `q` output is declared as a 4-bit register.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` input.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   a. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0000`).
   b. If the `reset` input is low, the counter is incremented by 1, and if the counter reaches its maximum value of 15 (`4'b1111`), it is reset to 0.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 15, inclusive, and resets to 0 when the maximum value is reached, creating a period of 16.'}
