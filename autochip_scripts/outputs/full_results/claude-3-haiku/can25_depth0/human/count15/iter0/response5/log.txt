The corrected Verilog module code for a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16, and a synchronous active high reset input that resets the counter to 0.

The key changes are:

1. The `output reg [3:0] q` declaration to create a 4-bit register output.
2. The `always` block that updates the counter value `q` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `if-else` statement that checks for the reset condition and resets the counter to 0, or increments the counter by 1 if not reset.
4. The ternary operator `(q == 4'b1111) ? 4'b0000 : q + 1'b1` that checks if the counter has reached the maximum value of 15 (4'b1111) and resets it to 0, otherwise increments it by 1.'}
