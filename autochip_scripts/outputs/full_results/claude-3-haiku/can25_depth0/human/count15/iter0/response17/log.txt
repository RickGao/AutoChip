This Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous, and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
2. If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is set to 0.
3. If the `reset` input is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `q` is 15 (4'b1111), the next value is set to 0 to reset the counter.

This implementation ensures the counter counts from 0 to 15 and resets to 0 when the maximum value is reached, as per the given specification.'}
