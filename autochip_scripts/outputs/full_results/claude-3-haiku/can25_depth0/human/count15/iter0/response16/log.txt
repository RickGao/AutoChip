The provided Verilog module is correct and should compile without any issues. It implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15 inclusive, with a period of 16. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Inside the block, it checks the `reset` input:

- If `reset` is high, the counter `q` is set to 0.
- If `reset` is low, the counter `q` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `q` is 15, it is reset to 0 to start the cycle again.

The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.'}
