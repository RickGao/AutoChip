This Verilog module implements a full adder. The key components are:

1. A half adder to add the two input bits `a` and `b`, producing the sum `s1` and carry `c1`.
2. The full adder logic, which takes the half adder sum `s1` and the carry-in `cin`, and produces the final sum `sum` and carry-out `cout`.
   - The sum is computed as `s1 ^ cin`.
   - The carry-out is computed as `c1 | (s1 & cin)`, which combines the carry from the half adder with the carry generated by the addition of `s1` and `cin`.

This module correctly implements the full adder functionality and should compile without any errors.'}
