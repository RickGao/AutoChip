{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero.

This Verilog code implements a 4-bit priority encoder. The `always @(*)` block uses a case statement to determine the position of the first high bit in the 4-bit input vector `in`. The output `pos` is a 2-bit vector that represents the position of the first high bit, with 00 representing the first bit, 01 representing the second bit, 10 representing the third bit, and 11 representing the fourth bit. If all input bits are low (i.e., `in` is 4'b0000), the output `pos` is set to 2'b00.'}
