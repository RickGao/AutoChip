The Verilog code provided above implements the next-state logic for the state signals `y[2]` (corresponding to state B and C) and `y[4]` (corresponding to state D and E) based on the given state machine diagram and the one-hot encoding assumption.

For `Y2` (the next-state signal for `y[2]`):
- The state transitions from A to B, and from B to C, both occur when `w` is 0.
- Therefore, `Y2` is active when either `y[1]` (state A) and `w` is 0, or `y[3]` (state C) and `w` is 0.

For `Y4` (the next-state signal for `y[4]`):
- The state transitions from B to D, from C to D, and from F to D occur when `w` is 1.
- The state transition from D to A occurs when `w` is 0.
- Therefore, `Y4` is active when either `y[2]` (state B) and `w` is 1, or `y[5]` (state E) and `w` is 1, or `y[6]` (state F) and `w` is 0.

This Verilog code correctly implements the next-state logic for the given state machine diagram and one-hot encoding.'}
