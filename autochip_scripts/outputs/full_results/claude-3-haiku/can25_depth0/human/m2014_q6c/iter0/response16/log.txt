The Verilog code above implements the next-state logic for the state machine described in the given specification. The logic equations for `Y2` and `Y4` are derived by inspecting the state transition diagram and the state assignments.

For `Y2` (the next-state signal for `y[2]`):
- When the current state is `A (y[1])` and the input `w` is 0, the next state should be `B (y[2])`, so `y[1] & ~w` is included.
- When the current state is `B (y[2])` and the input `w` is 1, the next state should be `D (y[4])`, so `y[2] & w` is included.
- When the current state is `C (y[3])` and the input `w` is 0, the next state should be `E (y[5])`, so `y[3] & ~w` is included.
- When the current state is `D (y[4])` and the input `w` is 0, the next state should be `F (y[6])`, so `y[4] & ~w` is included.
- When the current state is `F (y[6])` and the input `w` is 1, the next state should be `A (y[1])`, so `y[6] & w` is included.

For `Y4` (the next-state signal for `y[4]`):
- When the current state is `B (y[2])` and the input `w` is 0, the next state should be `C (y[3])`, so `y[2] & ~w` is included.
- When the current state is `C (y[3])` and the input `w` is 1, the next state should be `D (y[4])`, so `y[3] & w` is included.
- When the current state is `D (y[4])` and the input `w` is 0, the next state should be `F (y[6])`, so `y[4] & ~w` is included.
- When the current state is `E (y[5])` and the input `w` is 1, the next state should be `D (y[4])`, so `y[5] & w` is included.
- When the current state is `F (y[6])` and the input `w` is 0, the next state should be `C (y[3])`, so `y[6] & ~w` is included.'}
