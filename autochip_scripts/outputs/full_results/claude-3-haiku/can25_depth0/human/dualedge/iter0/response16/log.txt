The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge of the clock. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the clock signal.

The key steps are:

1. Declare two additional registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` to hold the values sampled on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. Use separate `always` blocks to update `q_pos` on the positive edge and `q_neg` on the negative edge of the clock.
3. Use a third `always` block with a combinational sensitivity list `(*)` to assign the final output `q` based on the current state of the clock signal, selecting between `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This implementation achieves the functional behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without directly using the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` construction.'}
