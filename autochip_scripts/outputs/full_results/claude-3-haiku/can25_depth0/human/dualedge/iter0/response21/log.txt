The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`q_pos`) and one on the negative edge (`q_neg`).
2. The output `q` is then assigned based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` using a combinational `always` block.
3. This effectively recreates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, where the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

The choice of using `q_pos` in the case of `2'b11` is arbitrary, as the behavior is undefined in this case. However, choosing `q_pos` ensures consistent behavior with the other cases.'}
