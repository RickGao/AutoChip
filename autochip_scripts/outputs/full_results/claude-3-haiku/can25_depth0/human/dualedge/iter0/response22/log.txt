The key points in this implementation are:

1. Use two regular flip-flops, one triggered on the positive clock edge and the other on the negative clock edge.
2. The outputs of the two flip-flops are then combined using a multiplexer, which selects between the positive and negative edge triggered values based on the current clock value.
3. The `always @(*)` block with the case statement implements the multiplexer logic.
4. The default case in the multiplexer is used to avoid the creation of a latch.

This approach allows us to emulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard FPGA primitives, which do not support direct dual-edge triggering.'}
