{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two single-edge triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        q = (clk) ? q_pos : q_neg;
    end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
1. We use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in `q_pos`.
3. The `always @(negedge clk)` block captures the input `d` on the negative edge of the clock and stores it in `q_neg`.
4. The final output `q` is derived based on the current value of the clock signal. If the clock is high, `q` takes the value of `q_pos`, otherwise it takes the value of `q_neg`.

This implementation effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while using only single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are readily available in FPGAs.'}
