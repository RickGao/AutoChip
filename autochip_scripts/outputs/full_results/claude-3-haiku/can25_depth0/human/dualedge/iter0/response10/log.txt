{'assistant': 'Here is the Verilog code for a module that behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_int;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_int <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q <= q_int;
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use two always blocks to achieve the dual-edge triggered behavior. The first always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock and updates an internal signal `q_int` with the input `d`. The second always block is triggered on the negative edge of the clock and updates the output `q` with the value of `q_int`. This effectively creates a flip-flop that is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.'}
