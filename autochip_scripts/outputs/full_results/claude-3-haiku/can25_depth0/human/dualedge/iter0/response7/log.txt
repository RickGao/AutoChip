The key aspects of the code are:

1. Two internal registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` are used to capture the data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The first `always` block captures the data on the positive edge of the clock into `q_pos`.
3. The second `always` block captures the data on the negative edge of the clock into `q_neg`.
4. The third `always` block uses a case statement to determine the value of the output `q` based on the clock edge and the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This circuit effectively implements the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate edge-triggered flip-flops and combinational logic to combine their outputs.'}
