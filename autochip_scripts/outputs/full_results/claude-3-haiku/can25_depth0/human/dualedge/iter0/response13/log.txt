This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two standard positive-edge triggered flip-flops. The first flip-flop, `d_reg`, captures the input data `d` on the positive clock edge. The second flip-flop, `q`, captures the value of `d_reg` on the positive clock edge, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior.

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. The use of a separate register `d_reg` to capture the input data `d` on the positive clock edge.
2. The assignment of `d_reg` to the output `q` on the positive clock edge, which creates the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows you to implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using only standard positive-edge triggered flip-flops, which are commonly available in FPGA architectures.'}
