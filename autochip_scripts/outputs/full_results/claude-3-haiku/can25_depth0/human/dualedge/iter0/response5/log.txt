The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops and combinational logic. The key aspects are:

1. Two D flip-flops (`d_ff1` and `d_ff2`) are used to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the two flip-flops in sequence.
3. The `always @(*)` block selects the appropriate flip-flop output (`d_ff1` or `d_ff2`) based on the current value of the clock signal.

This design ensures that the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
