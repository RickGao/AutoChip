The provided code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of two separate always blocks:

1. The first `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock and updates the output `q` with the current input `d`.
2. The second `always` block triggers on the negative edge of the clock and stores the input `d` in the temporary variable `tmp_q`.
3. The third `always` block is triggered on both the positive and negative edges of the clock. It compares the current value of `q` with the temporary value `tmp_q`, and updates `q` with the appropriate value based on the comparison.

This approach allows the module to simulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not natively support such functionality.'}
