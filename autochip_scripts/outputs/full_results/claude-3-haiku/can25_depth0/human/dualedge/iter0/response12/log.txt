{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that simulates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two single-edge triggered flip-flops:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin

        end else begin
            q <= q_neg;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops (`q_pos` and `q_neg`) to capture the data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. Use an additional always block that checks for both the positive and negative edges of the clock to update the output `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This approach allows you to simulate the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops, which are supported by FPGAs.'}
