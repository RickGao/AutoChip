The key points in this implementation are:

1. We use two positive-edge and negative-edge triggered flip-flops to capture the data on both clock edges.
2. We then use a multiplexer to select the appropriate output based on the current clock edge.
3. This way, we can achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard FPGA primitives.'}
