{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.

{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops triggered on the posedge and negedge of the clock:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_posedge, q_negedge;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_posedge <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_negedge <= d;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (clk)
            q <= q_posedge;
        else
            q <= q_negedge;
    end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. We use two separate flip-flops `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` to capture the input `d` on the posedge and negedge of the clock respectively.
2. In the final `always` block, we mux the outputs of the two flip-flops based on the current clock value to get the final output `q`, which behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

This implementation avoids the use of the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list, and instead uses two separate `always` blocks to handle the posedge and negedge of the clock separately.'}
