The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a regular positive-edge-triggered flip-flop and some additional logic. Here's how it works:

1. The `d_reg` register is used to store the input `d` signal on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The main `q` register is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, using the `always @(posedge clk, negedge clk)` construct. This is not a legal Verilog construct, as FPGAs do not have dual-edge-triggered flip-flops.
3. Inside the `always` block, the `if (clk)` statement checks if the clock is high, and then assigns the value of `d_reg` to the output `q`. This effectively implements the dual-edge triggering behavior.

By using this approach, the circuit will functionally behave like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though it is implemented using regular single-edge-triggered flip-flops.'}
