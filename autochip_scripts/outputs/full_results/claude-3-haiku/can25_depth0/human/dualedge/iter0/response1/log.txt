        end
    end

endmodule
```

The key steps are:

1. Use two separate registers, `q_reg1` and `q_reg2`, to capture the input data on the positive and negative clock edges, respectively.
2. In the final output logic, check the current clock state to select between `q_reg1` and `q_reg2` to produce the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops available in FPGAs.'}
