The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use two D flip-flops in series (d_ff1 and d_ff2) to capture the input data (d) on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.
2. The first flip-flop (d_ff1) captures the input data (d) on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The second flip-flop (d_ff2) captures the output of the first flip-flop (d_ff1) on the positive edge of the clock.
4. The final output (q) is generated by XORing the outputs of the two flip-flops (d_ff1 and d_ff2).

This effectively emulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, as the output (q) changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, based on the input (d).'}
