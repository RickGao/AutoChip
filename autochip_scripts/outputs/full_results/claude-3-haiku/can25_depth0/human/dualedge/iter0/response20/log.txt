```

The key points in the solution are:

1. Create two instances of a single-edge triggered flip-flop, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge.
2. Use the `always @(posedge clk)` and `always @(negedge clk)` constructs to update the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` respectively on the positive and negative edges of the clock.
3. Combine the outputs of the two flip-flops using a final `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` block to get the dual-edge behavior.
4. Assign the combined output to the `q` output port.

This approach allows you to emulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available single-edge triggered flip-flops on an FPGA.'}
