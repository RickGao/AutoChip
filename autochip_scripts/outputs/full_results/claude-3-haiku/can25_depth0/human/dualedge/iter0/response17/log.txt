The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a single-edge triggered flip-flop. The key aspects are:

1. A registered version of the input `d` signal is stored in the `d_reg` register.
2. The output `q` is assigned based on the current clock signal and the current and previous values of `d`:
   - If the clock is high, `q` is assigned the current value of `d`.
   - If the clock is low, `q` is assigned the previous value of `d`, stored in `d_reg`.

This effectively captures the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, where the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal.'}
