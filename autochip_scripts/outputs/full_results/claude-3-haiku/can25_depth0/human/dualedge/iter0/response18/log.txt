The key points in this implementation are:

1. We use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` and `always @(negedge clk)` blocks update the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
3. The final `q` output is assigned based on the current value of the clock signal. If the clock is high, `q` takes the value of `q_pos`, otherwise it takes the value of `q_neg`.

This implementation effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while being compatible with FPGA hardware that only supports single-edge triggered flip-flops.'}
