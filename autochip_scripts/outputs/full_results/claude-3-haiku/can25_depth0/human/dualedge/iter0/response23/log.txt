This Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The final output `q` is then generated by combining the outputs of the two flip-flops based on the current state of the clock signal.

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. Use of two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative clock edges, respectively.
2. The final output `q` is determined by the `always` block that combines the outputs of the two flip-flops based on the current state of the clock signal.

This approach allows you to create a functionally equivalent circuit to a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, which is not directly supported by FPGAs.'}
