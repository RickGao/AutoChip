```verilog
module top_module (

    input k,
    output reg Q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    case ({j, k})

        2'b11: Q <= ~Q;    // ~Qold
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

The changes made are:

1. The always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`).
2. The case statement is used to implement the JK flip-flop logic based on the truth table provided.
   - `2'b00`: Qold (the previous value of Q) is retained.
   - `2'b01`: Q is set to 0.
   - `2'b10`: Q is set to 1.
   - `2'b11`: Q is set to the complement of the previous value (~Qold).
3. The output `Q` is declared as a `reg` type, as it is being updated in the always block.

This Verilog module correctly implements the JK flip-flop behavior based on the given truth table.'}
