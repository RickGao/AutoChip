The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key aspects are:

1. The module has a 32-bit output register `q` to hold the LFSR value.
2. In the always block, on the positive edge of the clock:
   - If `reset` is high, `q` is set to the initial value of `32'h1`.
   - Otherwise, the LFSR is updated by shifting the existing bits one position to the left and XORing the leftmost bit with the bits at positions 22, 2, and 1 to produce the new rightmost bit.

This implementation of a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps should work correctly.'}
