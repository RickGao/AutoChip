The provided Verilog code implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The LFSR is reset to 32'h1 when the `reset` input is active high.

The `always` block handles the LFSR update on the positive edge of the `clk` input. When `reset` is high, the `q` register is set to 32'h1. When `reset` is low, the LFSR is updated by shifting the bits one position to the right, and the new least significant bit is computed as the XOR of the following bit positions: 31, 21, 1, and 0.

This implementation should meet the given requirements for a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps and a synchronous reset.'}
