{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four states: `STATE_A` (reset state), `STATE_B` (set `f` to 1 for one clock cycle), `STATE_C` (monitor `x` for 1, 0, 1 pattern), and `STATE_D` (monitor `y` to set `g` permanently).
2. The module uses a `current_state` and `next_state` register to keep track of the current state and the next state, respectively.
3. The module also uses an `x_count` register to keep track of the number of consecutive 1, 0, 1 values on the `x` input.
4. The `always` block for the state transition logic checks the current state and updates the next state accordingly, as well as sets the output values `f` and `g`.
5. The module resets the state to `STATE_A` when the `resetn` input is low, and sets `f` and `g` to 0 in this state.
6. When the `resetn` input goes high, the module transitions to `STATE_B`, where it sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
7. The module then transitions to `STATE_C`, where it monitors the `x` input for the 1, 0, 1 pattern. If the pattern is detected, the module transitions to `STATE_D` and sets `g` to 1.
8. In `STATE_D`, the module monitors the `y` input. If `y` is 1 within two clock cycles, the module maintains `g` at 1 permanently (until reset). If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, the module sets `g` to 0 permanently (until reset).'}
