{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following features:

1. It has the required inputs and outputs: `clk`, `resetn`, `x`, `y`, `f`, and `g`.
2. It defines four states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.
3. The `current_state` and `next_state` registers keep track of the current and next states of the FSM.
4. The `x_history` array stores the last two values of the `x` input to detect the sequence `1`, `0`, `1`.
5. The `always` block handles the state transitions and updates the output signals `f` and `g` based on the current state and inputs.
6. In the `STATE_A` (reset) state, the FSM sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle when the reset is de-asserted.
7. In the `STATE_B` state, the FSM checks the sequence of `x` values to transition to the `STATE_C`.
8. In the `STATE_C` state, the FSM sets `g` to 1 and checks the `y` input to determine whether to maintain `g = 1` or set `g = 0` permanently.
9. In the `STATE_D` state, the FSM maintains `g = 1` permanently.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the required finite state machine behavior.'}
