{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The FSM has four states: A, B, C, and D, and it operates as follows:

1. In state A (the initial state), the FSM waits for the reset signal (resetn) to be de-asserted. Once the reset is de-asserted, the FSM transitions to state B.
2. In state B, the FSM sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle and then transitions to state C.
3. In state C, the FSM monitors the input `x`. If `x` is 1, the FSM stays in state C. If `x` is 0, the FSM transitions to state D and starts counting the `x` transitions.
4. In state D, the FSM monitors the `x` input. If `x` is 1, it increments the `x_count` variable. If `x_count` reaches 2 (indicating that `x` has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles), the FSM sets the output `g` to 1. It then monitors the `y` input. If `y` is 1 within the next two clock cycles, the FSM stays in state D with `g` set to 1. If `y` is not 1 within the next two clock cycles, the FSM sets `g` to 0 permanently (until the next reset).

The code uses a `case` statement to handle the state transitions and the output logic. The `x_count` variable is used to keep track of the transitions of the `x` input.'}
