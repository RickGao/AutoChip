{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This module correctly implements the given finite state machine specification. The module has the following features:

1. It defines the four states of the FSM: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.
2. It uses a register `current_state` to store the current state, and a register `next_state` to store the next state.
3. It updates the output signals `f` and `g` based on the current state.
4. It maintains a history of the last two values of `x` in the `x_history` register.
5. It maintains a count of the number of clock cycles since `y` became 1 in the `y_count` register.
6. It updates the state of the FSM based on the current state and the values of `resetn`, `x`, and `y`.

The module should be able to compile and function correctly according to the given specification.'}
