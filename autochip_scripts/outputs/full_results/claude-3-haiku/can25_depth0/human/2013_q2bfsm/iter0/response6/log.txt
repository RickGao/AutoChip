{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine as described in the specification. The module has the following features:

1. Defines the states of the FSM using parameters: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.
2. Maintains the current state in the `state` register and the next state in the `next_state` register.
3. Stores the sequence of `x` values in the `x_seq` register.
4. Counts the number of clock cycles since `y` became 1 in the `y_count` register.
5. Implements the combinational logic to determine the next state and the output values `f` and `g` based on the current state and the input values `x` and `y`.
6. Implements the sequential logic to update the state on the positive edge of the clock, and resets the state and other registers when the `resetn` signal is asserted.

The module correctly sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle after the reset signal is de-asserted, and sets the output `g` to 1 when the sequence `x = 1, 0, 1` is detected, and maintains `g = 1` if `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, otherwise sets `g = 0` permanently.'}
