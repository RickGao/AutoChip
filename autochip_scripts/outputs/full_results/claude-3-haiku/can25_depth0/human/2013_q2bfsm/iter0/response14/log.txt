{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The provided Verilog module specification describes a finite state machine (FSM) that controls a motor based on inputs `x` and `y`. The FSM has the following behavior:

1. When the `resetn` signal is low, the FSM stays in the `A` state, setting both `f` and `g` to 0.
2. When `resetn` is high, the FSM transitions to the `B` state, setting `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
3. In the `C` state, the FSM monitors the `x` input, looking for the sequence 1, 0, 1.
4. If the 1, 0, 1 sequence is detected on `x`, the FSM transitions to the `D` state and sets `g` to 1.
5. In the `D` state, the FSM monitors the `y` input. If `y` becomes 1 within 2 clock cycles, `g` remains set to 1 permanently (until reset). If `y` does not become 1 within 2 clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently (until reset).

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the given FSM specification.'}
