{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. It has the following features:

1. The module has the required input and output ports: `clk`, `resetn`, `x`, `y`, `f`, and `g`.
2. The module uses four states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D` to represent the different states of the FSM.
3. The `state` register keeps track of the current state, and the `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input values.
4. The `x_count` register keeps track of the number of consecutive 1-0-1 transitions on the `x` input.
5. The output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle when the FSM transitions from `STATE_A` to `STATE_B`.
6. The output `g` is set based on the value of the `y` input and the `x_count` register, as per the specification.
7. The module uses synchronous reset, where the FSM always starts in `STATE_A` when the `resetn` signal is low.'}
