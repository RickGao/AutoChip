{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The Verilog module provided here implements the finite state machine described in the specification. It has the following features:

1. The module has four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. In state A, the reset condition is handled, and the outputs f and g are set to 0.
3. In state B, the output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle.
4. In state C, the output f is set to 0, and the FSM waits for x to have the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles.
5. In state D, the output g is set to 1 if x has the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, and y becomes 1 within two clock cycles. If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently.
6. The state transitions are controlled based on the values of the inputs x and y, as well as the current state.

This module should correctly implement the specified finite state machine behavior.'}
