This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures. Describe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion).

The provided Verilog code represents the FSM described in the given specification. It includes the following components:

1. State assignment: The states are assigned the codes A, B, C, and D.
2. State registers: The current state is stored in the `state` register, and the next state is calculated in the `next_state` register.
3. State update logic: The `state` register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset signal `resetn` sets the state to A.
4. Next state logic: The `next_state` is calculated based on the current state and the values of the input signals `r[1]`, `r[2]`, and `r[3]`.
5. Output logic: The output signals `g[1]`, `g[2]`, and `g[3]` are assigned based on the current state.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the described arbiter circuit FSM.'}
