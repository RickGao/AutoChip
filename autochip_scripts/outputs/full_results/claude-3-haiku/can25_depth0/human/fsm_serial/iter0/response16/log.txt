{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM consists of the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state, waiting for the start bit of a new byte.
2. **START_BIT**: Verifies the start bit (logic 0) to ensure the byte transmission is valid.
3. **DATA_BITS**: Shifts in the 8 data bits, one by one, in the least significant bit first order.
4. **STOP_BIT**: Checks the stop bit (logic 1) to ensure the byte transmission is complete.
5. **ERROR**: If the stop bit is not detected as expected, the FSM enters this state and waits until a valid stop bit is found before attempting to receive the next byte.

The FSM uses the following registers:
- `state`: Stores the current state of the FSM.
- `bit_count`: Keeps track of the number of data bits received.
- `data_reg`: Stores the 8-bit data received.
- `done`: An output signal that is set high when a byte has been successfully received.

The FSM handles the synchronous reset signal `reset` to initialize the state machine and the registers.'}
