{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk` (clock), `in` (serial data input), and `reset` (asynchronous reset).
2. The module has one output: `done` (high when a complete byte has been received).
3. The module uses a 2-bit state variable to represent the four states of the FSM: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, and `STOP`.
4. The module uses a 3-bit `bit_count` variable to keep track of the current position within the 8-bit data byte.
5. The module uses an 8-bit `data_reg` variable to store the received data byte.
6. The module's state transition logic ensures that the start bit is detected, the 8 data bits are received, and the stop bit is verified. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM waits until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
7. The module includes a synchronous reset functionality that resets the state, bit_count, data_reg, and done signal when the `reset` input is high.

The module correctly implements the given serial communication protocol and should be able to identify when bytes have been correctly received.'}
