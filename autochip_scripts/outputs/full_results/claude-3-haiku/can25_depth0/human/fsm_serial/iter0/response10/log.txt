{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received from a stream of bits. The FSM consists of the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state, waiting for the start bit.
2. **START**: Verifies the start bit.
3. **DATA**: Shifts in the 8 data bits.
4. **STOP**: Verifies the stop bit.
5. **ERROR**: Waits for the stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module takes in three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `in` (the input bit stream), and `reset` (a synchronous reset signal). The output `done` is set high when a byte has been successfully received.

The FSM operates as follows:

1. In the **IDLE** state, it waits for the start bit (a logic 0).
2. Once the start bit is detected, it transitions to the **START** state to verify that the start bit is valid.
3. If the start bit is valid, it moves to the **DATA** state, where it shifts in the 8 data bits, least significant bit first.
4. After all 8 data bits have been received, the FSM transitions to the **STOP** state to verify the stop bit.
5. If the stop bit is valid (a logic 1), the `done` output is set high, and the FSM returns to the **IDLE** state.
6. If the stop bit is not valid, the FSM enters the **ERROR** state, where it waits until it detects a valid stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the `reset` input will reset the FSM to the **IDLE** state and clear the `done` output and internal registers.'}
