{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The finite state machine in this Verilog code has the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. **START**: Shifts in the 8 data bits, one per clock cycle.
3. **STOP**: Verifies the stop bit (1) and sets the `done` signal high if it is correct.
4. **ERROR**: Waits for the stop bit (1) to be detected if the previous stop bit was incorrect.

The state machine uses the `bit_count` register to keep track of the number of bits received, and the `data_reg` register to store the 8-bit data byte. The `done` signal is set high when a valid byte has been received.

The state machine also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state to `IDLE` and clears the `done` signal when the `reset` input is high.'}
