{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine to identify correctly received bytes in a serial communications protocol. The state machine has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (logic 0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, and then checks if the stop bit (logic 1) is received correctly.
3. `STOP`: Sets the `done` output high to indicate a successfully received byte, and then transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
4. `ERROR`: Waits for the stop bit to be detected, and then transitions back to the `IDLE` state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset signal that resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and clears the `data_reg` and `done` signals.'}
