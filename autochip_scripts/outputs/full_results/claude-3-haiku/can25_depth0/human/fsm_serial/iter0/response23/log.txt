{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits.

Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset.

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The protocol uses one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and one stop bit (1), with the line being at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle).

The FSM has four states:
1. **IDLE**: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. **START**: Verifies the start bit and waits for the 8 data bits.
3. **DATA**: Reads the 8 data bits and stores them in the `data_reg` register.
4. **STOP**: Verifies the stop bit (1) and sets the `done` output high if the stop bit is correct.

The module also includes a synchronous reset, which resets the state machine and the registers to their initial values.

The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, so the data bits are stored in the `data_reg` register accordingly.'}
