{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The state machine has four states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit detection.
2. `START_BIT`: Verifies the start bit is valid.
3. `DATA_BITS`: Shifts in the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifies the stop bit is valid and sets the `done` output high.

The module uses a `bit_count` register to track the current bit position within the 8-bit data byte, and a `data_reg` register to store the received data. The `done` output is set high when a valid byte has been received.

The module also includes a synchronous active-high reset, which resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and clears the `done` output.'}
