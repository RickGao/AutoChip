{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The key changes I made to the provided module are:

1. Added a `done` output signal that is set to 1 when a byte has been successfully received.
2. Implemented the finite state machine with the following states:
   - `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
   - `START_BIT`: Verifying the start bit.
   - `DATA_BITS`: Shifting in the 8 data bits.
   - `STOP_BIT`: Verifying the stop bit.
   - `ERROR`: Handling errors, such as an incorrect stop bit.
3. Implemented the bit counting and data shifting logic within the state machine.
4. Included a synchronous reset that sets the module back to the `IDLE` state and resets all internal registers.

This module should correctly identify and receive bytes from the provided serial communication protocol.'}
