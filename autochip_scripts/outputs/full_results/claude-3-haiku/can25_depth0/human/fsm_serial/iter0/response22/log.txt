{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset.

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to begin receiving a byte.
2. `START`: Receives the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
3. `STOP`: Verifies that the stop bit (1) is received, and sets the `done` output high if the byte is successfully received.
4. If the stop bit is not received as expected, the FSM transitions back to the `IDLE` state to wait for the next start bit.

The module also includes a synchronous reset input `reset` that resets the FSM to the `IDLE` state and clears the `data_reg` and `done` outputs.'}
