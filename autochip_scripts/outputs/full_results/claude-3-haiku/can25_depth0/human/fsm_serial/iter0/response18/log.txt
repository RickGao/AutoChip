{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine to identify correctly received bytes from a stream of bits. It has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START_BIT`: Verifies the start bit is valid (0).
3. `DATA_BITS`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, one by one.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Checks if the stop bit (1) is valid.
5. `WAIT_STOP`: Waits for the stop bit to become valid (1) before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a `done` output that is asserted when a byte has been successfully received. The `reset` input is a synchronous reset that clears the state machine and resets all the internal registers.'}
