{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following features:

1. **States**: The module has four states - IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.
2. **Bit Counting**: The `bit_count` register keeps track of the number of bits received within the START and DATA states.
3. **Data Capture**: The `data_reg` register stores the 8-bit data being received, with the least significant bit received first.
4. **Stop Bit Verification**: The module checks for the correct stop bit (1) in the STOP state before setting the `done` output high and returning to the IDLE state.
5. **Reset**: The module has a synchronous reset that initializes the state, bit count, and data register.

The module correctly handles the serial communication protocol as described in the problem statement.'}
