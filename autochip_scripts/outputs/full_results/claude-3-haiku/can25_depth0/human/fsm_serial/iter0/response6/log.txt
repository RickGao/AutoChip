{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset.

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit.

The FSM has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit.
2. `START`: Waits for the 8 bit times to elapse after the start bit is detected.
3. `DATA`: Samples the 8 data bits and stores them in the `data_reg`.
4. `STOP`: Waits for the stop bit to be detected, and sets the `done` signal high when a complete byte has been received.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the FSM to the `IDLE` state and clears the `data_reg` and `done` signal when the `reset` input is high.

The module assumes that the serial data is sent with the least significant bit first, which is a common convention in serial communication protocols.'}
