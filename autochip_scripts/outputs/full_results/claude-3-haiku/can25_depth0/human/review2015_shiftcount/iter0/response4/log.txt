This Verilog module implements the four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The key points are:

1. The `q` register is a 4-bit wide register to hold the current value.
2. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the `shift_ena` and `count_ena` inputs to determine the operation.
3. When `shift_ena` is 1, the module shifts in the `data` input into the most-significant-bit of `q`, effectively shifting the existing value one bit to the left.
4. When `count_ena` is 1, the module decrements the current value of `q` by 1.
5. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1, the module will prioritize the shift operation and shift in the new data.

This module should correctly implement the desired functionality of the four-bit shift register with down counter.'}
