This Verilog module implements a 4-bit shift register that also functions as a down counter. The `q` register holds the current value of the shift register/counter.

The module has the following behavior:

1. When `shift_ena` is 1, the input `data` is shifted into the register, with the MSB going into the MSB of `q`, and the existing bits in `q` shifted one position to the right.
2. When `count_ena` is 1, the value in `q` is decremented by 1.
3. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1, the module will prioritize the shift operation and shift the new data into the register.

The module uses a single `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal to handle both the shift and count operations.'}
