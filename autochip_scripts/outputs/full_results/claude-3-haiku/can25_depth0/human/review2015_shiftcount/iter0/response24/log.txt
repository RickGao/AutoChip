{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1.

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The implemented module correctly performs the described functionality:

1. When `shift_ena` is 1, the input `data` is shifted into the most significant bit of the 4-bit register `q`, and the rest of the bits are shifted one position to the right.
2. When `count_ena` is 1, the value in the 4-bit register `q` is decremented by 1.
3. If both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1 at the same time, the behavior of the circuit does not matter, as per the specification.

The module is implemented using a single `always` block that checks the values of `shift_ena` and `count_ena` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` and updates the register `q` accordingly.'}
