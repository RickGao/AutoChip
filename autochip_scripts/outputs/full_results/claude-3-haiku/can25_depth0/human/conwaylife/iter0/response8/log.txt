{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

The provided Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The key features of the implementation are:

1. Helper functions `wrap()` and `index()` to handle the toroidal grid behavior.
2. A combinational logic function `next_state()` to compute the next state of a cell based on its current state and number of neighbors.
3. A 2D array `neighbors` to store the number of neighbors for each cell.
4. An always block that handles the loading of the initial state and the update of the game state on each clock cycle.

The module correctly computes the next state of the game board by iterating over all cells, counting the number of neighbors for each cell, and updating the state based on the rules of the Game of Life.'}
