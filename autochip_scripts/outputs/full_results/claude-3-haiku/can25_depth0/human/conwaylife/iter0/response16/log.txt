{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

The provided module correctly implements the Game of Life rules on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `load` signal is used to load the initial state into the `q` register, and the `next_q` register is used to compute the next state based on the rules. The updated state is then assigned to `q` on the next clock edge.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `next_q` register is used to compute the next state based on the current state `q` and the Game of Life rules.
2. The logic to compute the number of neighbors for each cell takes into account the toroidal nature of the grid, ensuring that the corner cells have the correct number of neighbors.
3. The updated state is assigned to `q` on the next clock edge, ensuring that the game state advances by one timestep every clock cycle.'}
