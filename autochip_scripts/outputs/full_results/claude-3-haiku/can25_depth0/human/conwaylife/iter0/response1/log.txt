This Verilog module implements the rules of the Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the game, and the `q` output represents the current state of the game, which is updated every clock cycle.

The module uses a combination of combinational and sequential logic to implement the Game of Life rules. The `next_q` register is used to store the next state of the game, which is then assigned to the `q` register on the next clock cycle. The combinational logic iterates through each cell in the grid, counts the number of alive neighbors for the current cell, and updates the next state of the cell based on the Game of Life rules.

The module also handles the toroidal nature of the grid by considering the neighbors that wrap around the edges of the grid. For example, the top-left neighbor of the cell at (0,0) is the cell at (15,15).'}
