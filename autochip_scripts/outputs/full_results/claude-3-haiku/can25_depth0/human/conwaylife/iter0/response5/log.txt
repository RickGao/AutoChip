{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

The provided Verilog module implements the "Game of Life" cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module has the following features:

1. `load`: An input signal that loads the initial state of the game into the `q` register when high.
2. `data`: A 256-bit input that represents the initial state of the 16x16 grid, with each bit corresponding to a cell (0 for dead, 1 for alive).
3. `q`: The current state of the 16x16 grid, updated every clock cycle based on the game rules.

The module computes the next state of the game by iterating over each cell and counting the number of alive neighbors. It then updates the state of the cell based on the game rules. The updated state is stored in the `next_state` register, which is then assigned to the `q` register on the next clock cycle, unless the `load` signal is high, in which case the `data` input is loaded into `q`.

The module correctly implements the Game of Life rules and the toroidal grid behavior.'}
