{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state.

This implementation of the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid follows the rules you specified:

1. The `next_q` register holds the next state of the game, which is calculated in the always block that iterates over all 256 cells.
2. For each cell, the number of live neighbors is counted by checking the adjacent cells, accounting for the toroidal wraparound.
3. The next state of the cell is determined based on the rules you provided:
   - If the cell is currently alive and has 0-1 or 4+ neighbors, it becomes dead.
   - If the cell is currently alive and has 2 neighbors, its state does not change.
   - If the cell is currently dead and has 3 neighbors, it becomes alive.
4. The current state `q` is updated with the `next_q` state on the positive edge of the clock, with the `load` signal allowing the initial state to be loaded.

This should correctly implement the Game of Life on the specified 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
