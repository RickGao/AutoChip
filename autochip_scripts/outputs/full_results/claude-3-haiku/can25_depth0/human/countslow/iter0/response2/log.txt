This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 inclusive, with a period of 10. The counter is controlled by the following inputs:

1. `clk`: The clock signal.
2. `slowena`: If high, the counter will increment on the next clock cycle. If low, the counter will remain at the current value.
3. `reset`: If high, the counter will be reset to 0.

The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current count value.

The `always` block inside the module handles the counter logic:

1. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.
2. If the `slowena` input is high, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 9 (binary 1001), it wraps around to 0 on the next increment.
3. If the `slowena` input is low, the counter value remains unchanged.'}
