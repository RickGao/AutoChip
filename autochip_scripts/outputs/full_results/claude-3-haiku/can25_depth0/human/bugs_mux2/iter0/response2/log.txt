The original code had an error in the assign statement. The correct way to implement an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer is to use a conditional statement (if-else) inside an always block. The assign statement used in the original code would not work for an 8-bit wide bus, as it would result in a bitwise operation instead of a selective assignment.

In the corrected module, the always block checks the value of the sel input and assigns the corresponding input (a or b) to the output reg out.'}
