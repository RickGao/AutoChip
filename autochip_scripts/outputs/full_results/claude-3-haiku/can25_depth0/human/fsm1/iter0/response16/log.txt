The Verilog code above implements the Moore state machine described in the given specification. The key points are:

1. The state and next_state registers are declared as 2-bit wide to represent the two states A and B.
2. The always block for state update has a synchronous reset to state B when the `areset` signal is high.
3. The combinational always block computes the next state and output based on the current state and input `in`.
4. The output `out` is set to 0 when in state A, and 1 when in state B.
5. The default case covers any unspecified state and transitions to state B with output 1.

This implementation should correctly capture the behavior described in the state machine diagram.'}
