The provided Verilog module correctly implements the functionality of adding two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detecting signed overflow. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The `sum` wire is declared as a 9-bit wide signal to accommodate the possible overflow bit.
2. The `sum` signal is assigned the result of adding `a` and `b`.
3. The lower 8 bits of `sum` are assigned to the output `s`.
4. The `overflow` output is assigned based on the condition that checks if the signs of `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign of the result `sum[7]` is different. This indicates a signed overflow has occurred.

This Verilog module should compile and function as expected.'}
