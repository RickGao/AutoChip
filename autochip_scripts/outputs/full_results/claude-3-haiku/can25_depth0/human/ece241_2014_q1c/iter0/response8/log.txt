The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `sum` signal is declared as a 9-bit wide wire to accommodate the possible carry-out bit from the addition of the two 8-bit signed numbers.
2. The `sum` signal is assigned the result of adding the two 8-bit numbers, with the most significant bit of each operand extended to 9 bits to preserve the sign.
3. The `s` output is assigned the lower 8 bits of the `sum` signal.
4. The `overflow` output is assigned a value that indicates whether a signed overflow has occurred. The condition for overflow is that the two operands have the same sign, but the result has a different sign.'}
