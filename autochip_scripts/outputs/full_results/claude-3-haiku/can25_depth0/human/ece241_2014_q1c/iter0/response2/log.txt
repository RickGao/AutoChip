```

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given specification. The key steps are:

1. Use a 9-bit wire `sum` to store the 9-bit sum of the two 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`.
2. Assign the 8-bit output `s` to the lower 8 bits of `sum`.
3. Detect overflow by checking if the two input operands have the same sign (both positive or both negative) but the result has a different sign. This is achieved by the condition `(a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7])`.

The module is complete and should compile without any errors.'}
