The provided Verilog module correctly implements the required functionality. The key points are:

1. The addition is performed using a 9-bit wire `sum` to accommodate the possible carry-out bit.
2. The sum output `s` is assigned the lower 8 bits of the `sum` wire.
3. The overflow condition is detected by checking if the most significant bits of the 9-bit `sum` are not the same, which indicates a signed overflow.

This module should compile and function as expected.'}
