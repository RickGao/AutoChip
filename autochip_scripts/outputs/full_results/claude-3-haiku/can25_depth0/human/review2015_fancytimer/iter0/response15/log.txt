{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want to create a timer with one input that:\n\n// (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input until it resumes searching after everything else is done.\n\n// The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. \n\n// When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).\n\n// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous. \n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput wire clk,\n\tinput wire reset,\n\tinput wire data,\n    output wire [3:0] count,\n    output reg counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input wire ack );"}

This Verilog module implements the timer functionality as described in the specification. It uses a state machine to handle the different stages of the timer operation, including waiting for the start sequence, shifting in the delay value, counting down the timer, and waiting for the user acknowledgement.

The module has the following ports:
- `clk`: The clock input
- `reset`: The synchronous reset input
- `data`: The serial data input
- `count`: The output that indicates the remaining time in the timer
- `counting`: The output that indicates the timer is currently counting
- `done`: The output that indicates the timer has finished counting and is waiting for acknowledgement
- `ack`: The input that indicates the user has acknowledged the timer completion

The state machine has the following states:
- `WAIT_START`: The initial state where the module waits for the start sequence (1101)
- `WAIT_DELAY`: The state where the module shifts in the 4-bit delay value
- `COUNTING`: The state where the module counts down the timer and outputs the remaining time
- `WAIT_ACK`: The state where the module waits for the user acknowledgement before resetting

The module uses a 16-bit timer register to accurately count the timer duration, and a 4-bit shift register to capture the start sequence and the delay value. The `counting` and `done` outputs are set accordingly during the different states of the state machine.'}
