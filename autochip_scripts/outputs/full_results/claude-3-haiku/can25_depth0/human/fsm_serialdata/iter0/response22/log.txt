{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states: `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_START`, `STATE_DATA`, and `STATE_STOP`.

The module starts in the `STATE_IDLE` state, waiting for the detection of a start bit (logic 0). Once a start bit is detected, the FSM transitions to the `STATE_START` state to wait for the end of the start bit. It then moves to the `STATE_DATA` state, where it shifts in the 8 data bits, one bit per clock cycle.

After all 8 data bits have been received, the FSM transitions to the `STATE_STOP` state, where it waits for the detection of the stop bit (logic 1). If the stop bit is detected, the correctly-received data byte is stored in the `out_byte` register, and the `done` signal is asserted. The FSM then returns to the `STATE_IDLE` state, ready to receive the next byte.

If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM will remain in the `STATE_IDLE` state, waiting for the next start bit, to ensure that it does not attempt to receive the next byte before the current one has been properly delimited.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the state, bit_count, data_reg, out_byte, and done signals are reset when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
