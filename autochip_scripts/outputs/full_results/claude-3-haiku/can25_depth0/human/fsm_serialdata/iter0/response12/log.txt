{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine to identify correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol. It has the following features:

1. It defines the states of the FSM: IDLE, START_BIT, DATA_BITS, STOP_BIT, and ERROR.
2. It uses a `bit_count` register to keep track of the number of data bits received.
3. It uses a `data_reg` register to store the received data byte.
4. The FSM transitions between the states based on the input `in` and the current state.
5. If the stop bit is not received as expected, the FSM enters the ERROR state and waits until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to receive the next byte.
6. The `done` signal is asserted when a complete and valid byte is received, and the `out_byte` output is updated with the received data byte.
7. The module has an active-high synchronous reset signal that resets the FSM to the IDLE state and clears the internal registers.'}
