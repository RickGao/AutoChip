{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine that identifies correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following features:

1. It detects the start bit (0) and waits for the 8 data bits, with the least significant bit received first.
2. It then verifies the stop bit (1) and outputs the correctly received 8-bit data byte when the stop bit is valid.
3. If the stop bit is not valid, it waits until it finds a valid stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
4. The `done` output is asserted each time a valid stop bit is detected, indicating that the `out_byte` output contains the correctly received data byte.
5. The module includes an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine and all internal variables.

The code correctly handles the serial communication protocol as described in the problem statement.'}
