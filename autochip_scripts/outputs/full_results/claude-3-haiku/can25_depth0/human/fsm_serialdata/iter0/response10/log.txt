{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine to identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The module takes in a stream of bits on the `in` input, and outputs the correctly received data byte on `out_byte` when the `done` signal is asserted.

The module has the following states:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit to be detected.
- `START`: Verifying the start bit is present.
- `DATA`: Shifting in the 8 data bits.
- `STOP`: Verifying the stop bit is present.

The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the number of data bits received, and a `data_reg` to store the 8-bit data byte. When the stop bit is correctly received, the module asserts the `done` signal and outputs the received data byte on `out_byte`.

If the stop bit is not present when expected, the module will wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset signal `reset`, which resets the state machine and output signals.'}
