{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that receives a stream of bits, identifies the start bit, waits for all 8 data bits, and then verifies the stop bit. The correctly-received data byte is output on the `out_byte` port, and the `done` signal is asserted each time a stop bit is detected.

The module has four states: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, and `STOP`. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the start bit (a low input). When the start bit is detected, the module transitions to the `START` state, where it waits for the start bit to end (a high input).

In the `DATA` state, the module shifts in the 8 data bits, one by one, into the `data_byte` register. Once all 8 data bits have been received, the module transitions to the `STOP` state, where it waits for the stop bit (a high input).

If the stop bit is detected, the module outputs the received data byte on the `out_byte` port and asserts the `done` signal. The module then returns to the `IDLE` state, ready to receive the next byte.

If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the module remains in the `STOP` state, waiting for the stop bit to appear before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset, which resets all internal state variables and outputs when the `reset` input is high.'}
