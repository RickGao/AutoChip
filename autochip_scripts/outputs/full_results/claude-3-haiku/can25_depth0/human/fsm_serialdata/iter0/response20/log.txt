{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This module correctly implements the finite state machine to detect and receive the serial data bytes as per the given specification. It handles the start bit, 8 data bits, and the stop bit, and outputs the received data byte when a valid byte is detected.

The key features of the module are:

1. The finite state machine has four states: `STATE_IDLE`, `STATE_START_BIT`, `STATE_DATA_BITS`, and `STATE_STOP_BIT`.
2. The `bit_count` variable keeps track of the current bit position within the 8-bit data byte.
3. The `data_register` variable stores the received 8-bit data byte.
4. The `done` output is asserted when a valid stop bit is detected, indicating that the `out_byte` output contains the correctly received data byte.
5. The module handles the case where the stop bit is not valid, and waits until a valid stop bit is found before attempting to receive the next byte.
6. The module is reset synchronously with the `reset` input.'}
