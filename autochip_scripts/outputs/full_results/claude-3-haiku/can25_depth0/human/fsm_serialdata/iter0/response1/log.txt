{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine that can identify correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol. The module takes in a stream of serial data bits (`in`) and a synchronous reset signal (`reset`), and outputs the correctly received data byte (`out_byte`) and a `done` signal to indicate when a byte has been successfully received.

The FSM has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (logic 0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Indicates the start bit has been detected, and the FSM is ready to receive the 8 data bits.
3. `RECEIVE`: Shifts the incoming data bits into the `data_reg` register, and keeps track of the number of bits received using the `bit_count` variable.
4. `STOP`: Verifies that the stop bit (logic 1) is detected, and then outputs the received data byte and asserts the `done` signal.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the current state and the value of the `in` input. If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM will remain in the `STOP` state until a valid stop bit is detected, before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state, registers, and output signals when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
