{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following features:

1. It uses a Start-Data-Stop bit encoding scheme, with 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit.
2. It waits for the start bit, then reads the 8 data bits, and finally verifies the stop bit.
3. If the stop bit is not as expected, it waits until it finds a valid stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
4. It outputs the correctly received data byte (`out_byte`) when the `done` signal is asserted.
5. It includes an active-high synchronous reset.
6. The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

The module uses a 3-bit state machine with the following states:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
- `START`: Detecting the start bit.
- `DATA`: Reading the 8 data bits.
- `STOP`: Verifying the stop bit.
- `WAIT_STOP`: Waiting for a valid stop bit before receiving the next byte.

The module updates the state, bit counter, and data bits on each clock cycle, and asserts the `done` signal when a valid stop bit is detected.'}
