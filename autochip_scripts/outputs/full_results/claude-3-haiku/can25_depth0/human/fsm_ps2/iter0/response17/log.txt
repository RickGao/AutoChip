{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module specification describes a finite state machine (FSM) that searches for message boundaries in a continuous byte stream, where the first byte of each three-byte message has in[3]=1. The FSM should signal the completion of a message (done) in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message is successfully received.

The corrected Verilog module handles the following:

1. The FSM has three states: `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, and `WAIT_THIRD`, representing the search for the first, second, and third bytes of a message, respectively.
2. The `byte_count` variable keeps track of the number of bytes received in the current message.
3. In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, the FSM waits for a byte with in[3]=1, which indicates the start of a new message. Once found, it transitions to the `WAIT_SECOND` state and increments the `byte_count`.
4. In the `WAIT_SECOND` state, the FSM checks if the `byte_count` is 1, meaning the second byte of the message has been received. If so, it transitions to the `WAIT_THIRD` state and increments the `byte_count`.
5. In the `WAIT_THIRD` state, the FSM checks if the `byte_count` is 2, meaning the third byte of the message has been received. If so, it sets the `done` output to 1, resets the `byte_count` to 0, and transitions back to the `WAIT_FIRST` state to search for the next message.
6. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `WAIT_FIRST`, the `byte_count` to 0, and the `done` output to 0.

The provided Verilog module should correctly implement the specified functionality.'}
