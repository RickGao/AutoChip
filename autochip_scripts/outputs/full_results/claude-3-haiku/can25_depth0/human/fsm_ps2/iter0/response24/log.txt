{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that searches for the start of a PS/2 mouse protocol message and signals when a complete message has been received. The module has the following states:

1. `WAIT_FOR_START`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the first byte of a message, which is indicated by `in[3]` being 1.
2. `AWAIT_BYTE2`: Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to this state to wait for the second byte of the message.
3. `AWAIT_BYTE3`: After the second byte is received, the module transitions to this state to wait for the third and final byte of the message.

When the third byte is received, the `done` output is set to 1 to indicate that a complete message has been received. The `done` output is set back to 0 in the next cycle, ready for the next message.

The module also includes a synchronous reset signal `reset`, which resets the state machine to the `WAIT_FOR_START` state and sets the `done` output to 0.'}
