{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module implements the required finite state machine to detect the start and end of a three-byte PS/2 mouse protocol message. The key points are:

1. The module has three states: `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, and `WAIT_THIRD` to track the reception of the three bytes.
2. In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, the module waits for a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a message.
3. Once the first byte is received, the state transitions to `WAIT_SECOND` to wait for the second byte.
4. After the second byte is received, the state transitions to `WAIT_THIRD` to wait for the third byte.
5. When the third byte is received, the `done` output is set to 1 to indicate the completion of the message reception.
6. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, resetting the state machine to the `WAIT_FIRST` state and setting the `done` output to 0.'}
