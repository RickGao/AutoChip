{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that searches for the start of a three-byte PS/2 mouse protocol message within a continuous byte stream. The FSM has four states:

1. `WAITING`: In this state, the module discards bytes until it encounters a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a message.
2. `BYTE1`: This state is entered after a byte with `in[3]` set to 1 is received, indicating the first byte of a message.
3. `BYTE2`: This state is entered after the second byte of the message is received.
4. `BYTE3`: This state is entered after the third byte of the message is received, and the `done` output is set to 1 to signal the receipt of a complete message.

The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the FSM to the `WAITING` state, and the `done` output is set to 0 during the reset.'}
