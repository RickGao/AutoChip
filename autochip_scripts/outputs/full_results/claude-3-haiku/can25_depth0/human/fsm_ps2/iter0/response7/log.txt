{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.

The provided Verilog module specification describes a finite state machine (FSM) that detects the boundaries of three-byte messages within a continuous byte stream. The algorithm used is to discard bytes until a byte with `in[3]=1` is encountered, which is assumed to be the first byte of a message. The FSM then waits for the remaining two bytes of the message before signaling the receipt of a complete message (`done` output).

The corrected Verilog module implements this functionality using a three-state FSM (`WAIT_BYTE1`, `WAIT_BYTE2`, `WAIT_BYTE3`). The state transitions and `done` output are handled in the `always` block, which is sensitive to the `clk` and `reset` inputs.

The key aspects of the corrected module are:

1. The `state` register is used to track the current state of the FSM.
2. In the `WAIT_BYTE1` state, the module waits for a byte with `in[3]=1`, which is the first byte of a message.
3. Once the first byte is received, the state transitions to `WAIT_BYTE2` to wait for the second byte.
4. After the second byte is received, the state transitions to `WAIT_BYTE3` to wait for the third byte.
5. When the third byte is received, the `done` output is set to `1'b1` to signal the completion of a message, and the state returns to `WAIT_BYTE1` to start the process again.
6. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the `state` to `WAIT_BYTE1` and the `done` output to `1'b0`.

This implementation ensures that the `done` output is correctly signaled in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message is received, as per the given specification.'}
