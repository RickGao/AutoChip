{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module above implements the finite state machine for the PS/2 mouse protocol as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in` (the input byte stream), and `reset`.
2. The module has one output: `done`, which is asserted for one clock cycle when a complete 3-byte message has been received.
3. The module uses two internal registers: `state` to track the current state of the FSM, and `count` to keep track of which byte in the 3-byte message is currently being received.
4. The FSM has two states:
   - State 0: Waiting for the first byte of a message (with `in[3]` set to 1).
   - State 1: Receiving the remaining two bytes of the message.
5. The `reset` input resets the FSM to the initial state (0) and clears the `done` output.

The module correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement.'}
