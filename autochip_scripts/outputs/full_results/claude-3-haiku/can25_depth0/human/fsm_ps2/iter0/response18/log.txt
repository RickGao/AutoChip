{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that searches for the start of a PS/2 mouse protocol message within a continuous byte stream. The module has the following behavior:

1. The module starts in the `IDLE` state, waiting for a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a new message.
2. When a byte with `in[3]` set to 1 is detected, the module transitions to the `WAIT_BYTE1` state, where it expects to receive the first byte of the message.
3. After receiving the first byte, the module transitions to the `WAIT_BYTE2` state, where it expects to receive the second byte of the message.
4. After receiving the second byte, the module transitions to the `WAIT_BYTE3` state, where it expects to receive the third and final byte of the message.
5. Once the third byte is received, the module sets the `done` output to 1 for one clock cycle, indicating that a complete message has been received.
6. The module then returns to the `IDLE` state, ready to detect the start of a new message.
7. If a `reset` signal is received, the module resets the state to `IDLE` and clears the `done` output.

This implementation ensures that the module correctly identifies the start and end of each PS/2 mouse protocol message within the continuous byte stream, and signals the completion of each message by setting the `done` output.'}
