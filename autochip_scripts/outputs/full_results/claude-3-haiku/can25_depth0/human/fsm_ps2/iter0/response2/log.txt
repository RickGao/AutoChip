{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that detects the boundaries of a PS/2 mouse protocol message within a continuous byte stream. The algorithm used is to discard bytes until a byte with `in[3]=1` is encountered, which is assumed to be the first byte of a three-byte message. Once all three bytes have been received, the `done` signal is asserted for one cycle to indicate that a complete message has been received.

The FSM has three states:
1. `WAIT_FIRST`: Waiting for the first byte of a message, with `in[3]=1`.
2. `WAIT_SECOND`: Waiting for the second byte of a message.
3. `WAIT_THIRD`: Waiting for the third byte of a message.

The `count` variable keeps track of the number of bytes received within the current message. The `reset` signal is used to synchronously reset the FSM to the initial `WAIT_FIRST` state and clear the `done` signal.'}
