{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine that searches for the start of a PS/2 mouse protocol message and signals when a complete 3-byte message has been received.

The FSM has three states:
1. `0`: Waiting for the first byte with `in[3] = 1`, which indicates the start of a message.
2. `1`: Received the first byte, waiting for the second byte.
3. `2`: Received the second byte, waiting for the third byte.

The `byte_count` variable keeps track of the number of bytes received in the current message. When the third byte is received (i.e., `byte_count == 3`), the `done` output is set to 1 to signal that a complete message has been received.

The `reset` input resets the FSM to the initial state `0` and clears the `done` output.'}
