The population count circuit can be implemented using a combination of XOR and AND gates. The key steps are:

1. Assign the least significant bit of the output `count` to the XOR of the three input bits. This gives the parity or count of the number of '1's.

2. Assign the second least significant bit of `count` to the OR of the three AND combinations of the input bits. This captures the cases where there are two '1's.

3. Assign the most significant bit of `count` to the AND of all three input bits. This captures the case where all three bits are '1'.

4. Finally, assign the output `out` to the least significant two bits of `count`.

This implementation correctly counts the number of '1's in the 3-bit input vector.'}
