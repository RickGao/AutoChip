The completed Verilog module for the population count circuit of a 3-bit input vector is as follows:

1. The module takes a 3-bit input vector `in` and produces a 2-bit output vector `out`.
2. The `always` block uses a `case` statement to determine the number of '1's in the input vector `in` and assigns the corresponding 2-bit value to `out`.
3. For example, if the input `in` is `3'b000`, the output `out` is set to `2'b00` as there are no '1's in the input.
4. If the input `in` is `3'b111`, the output `out` is set to `2'b11` as there are three '1's in the input.

The module correctly implements the population count functionality for a 3-bit input vector.'}
