The population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector can be implemented using a combination of XOR and AND gates. The logic is as follows:

1. The least significant bit of the output `count[0]` is the XOR of all three input bits `in[0]`, `in[1]`, and `in[2]`. This will give the count of the number of '1's in the input, modulo 2.
2. The most significant bit of the output `count[1]` is the OR of the three AND expressions `(in[0] & in[1])`, `(in[0] & in[2])`, and `(in[1] & in[2])`. This will give the count of the number of '1's in the input that are greater than or equal to 2.

Finally, the output `out` is assigned the value of the `count` wire.'}
