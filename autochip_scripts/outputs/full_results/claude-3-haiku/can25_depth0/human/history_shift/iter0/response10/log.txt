The provided Verilog module specification is complete and implementable. The module implements a 32-bit global history shift register with support for rolling back the state in response to a pipeline flush caused by a branch misprediction.

The module has the following functionality:

1. On a positive edge of the `clk` signal or when the `areset` signal is high, the module resets the `history_reg` to zero.
2. When `train_mispredicted` is high, the module loads the `history_reg` with the concatenation of `train_history` and `train_taken`. This updates the branch history register with the correct history after the completion of the mispredicted branch.
3. When `predict_valid` is high, the module shifts the `predict_taken` value into the `history_reg` from the least significant bit side, updating the branch history for the predicted branch.
4. The current value of the `history_reg` is assigned to the `predict_history` output port.

The module correctly handles the cases of a branch prediction and a branch misprediction occurring at the same time, with the misprediction taking precedence and updating the branch history accordingly.'}
