When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the direction of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs (train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the history after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence, because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the history counter to zero.\n\n\n\nmodule top_module\n(\n    input clk,\n    input areset,\n    input predict_valid,\n    input predict_taken,\n    output logic [31:0] predict_history,\n    \n    input train_mispredicted,\n    input train_taken,\n    input [31:0] train_history\n);'}
