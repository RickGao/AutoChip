The provided Verilog module is almost correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `shift_ena` output should be a registered signal (`reg shift_ena`) to ensure that it has the correct timing.
2. The state machine logic needs to be updated to properly handle the reset and shift enable requirements.

The corrected module is provided above. The key changes are:

- Declaring `shift_ena` as a registered output.
- Updating the state machine logic to assert `shift_ena` for 4 cycles when the FSM is in the `WAIT` and `SHIFT` states, and then deassert it in the `DONE` state.
- Resetting the state machine to the `WAIT` state when the reset signal is asserted.

This module should now correctly implement the desired behavior of enabling the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and asserting `shift_ena` for 4 cycles on reset.'}
