The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `shift_ena` signal as a `reg` type output, as it needs to be assigned a value in the always block.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 1 and the state transitions to `SHIFT`.
4. In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` signal remains high, and when the state reaches `SHIFT` again, the state transitions to `DONE`.
5. In the `DONE` state, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 0, and when the state reaches `DONE` again, the state transitions back to `IDLE`.
6. Added a `default` case to handle any unexpected state transitions.

This module will assert the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keep it deasserted until the next reset.'}
