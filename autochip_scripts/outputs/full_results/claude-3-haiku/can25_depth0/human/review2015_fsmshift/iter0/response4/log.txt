The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM has three states:

1. `IDLE`: In this state, `shift_ena` is set to 1 for the first 4 clock cycles after the reset signal is asserted. This ensures that the shift register is enabled for 4 cycles when the FSM is reset.
2. `SHIFT`: In this state, `shift_ena` is set to 1, and the state machine remains in this state until 4 clock cycles have elapsed.
3. `COUNT`: In this state, `shift_ena` is set to 0, and the state machine transitions back to the `IDLE` state, waiting for the next reset signal.

The module uses a `count` register to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state, and the `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the value of `count`.'}
