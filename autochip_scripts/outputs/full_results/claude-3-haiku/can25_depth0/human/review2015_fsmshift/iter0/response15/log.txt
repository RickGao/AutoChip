The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Defined the state machine with three states: IDLE, SHIFT, and DONE.
2. Added the reset logic to reset the state to IDLE on a positive edge of the reset signal.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the always block for the next_state assignment.
4. Assigned the shift_ena output based on the current state and the shift_ena value.
5. Ensured that shift_ena is asserted for 4 clock cycles when the state machine is in the SHIFT state.

This module should now correctly implement the specified functionality.'}
