The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output port to make it a register type.
2. Initialized the `state` register to `IDLE` when the `reset` signal is asserted.
3. Asserted `shift_ena` to `1'b1` in the `IDLE` state and kept it asserted for 4 clock cycles in the `SHIFT` state.
4. Deasserted `shift_ena` to `1'b0` in the `DONE` state and the default case.
5. Implemented the state machine logic to ensure that `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is in the `SHIFT` state.

This corrected module should now correctly implement the desired functionality of asserting `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keeping it deasserted until the next reset.'}
