The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Declared a `shift_ena` output as a `reg` type to allow it to be assigned a value.
2. Defined a `SHIFT_CYCLES` parameter to keep track of the number of cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. Declared a 2-bit `state` register to track the current state of the FSM (IDLE or SHIFT).
4. Added a `case` statement to handle the state transitions and the `shift_ena` output.
   - In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` is set to 1 until the `SHIFT_CYCLES` counter reaches 4, at which point the state transitions to `IDLE` and `shift_ena` is set to 0.
   - In the `IDLE` state, `shift_ena` is always 0.
   - The default case sets the state to `IDLE` and `shift_ena` to 0.
5. In the `reset` case, the state is set to `SHIFT` and `shift_ena` is set to 1 to ensure the shift register is enabled for 4 cycles after reset.

This corrected module should now correctly enable the shift register for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keep it disabled until the next reset.'}
