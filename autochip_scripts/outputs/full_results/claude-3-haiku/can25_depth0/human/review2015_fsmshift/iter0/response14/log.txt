The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared a `shift_ena` output port as a registered signal (`reg shift_ena`).
2. Defined a `SHIFT_CYCLES` parameter to keep track of the number of shift cycles.
3. Implemented a state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
4. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1` and the state transitions to `SHIFT`.
5. In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` is kept at `1'b1` until the `SHIFT_CYCLES` counter reaches 4, at which point the state transitions to `DONE` and `shift_ena` is set to `1'b0`.
6. In the `DONE` state, the `shift_ena` is kept at `1'b0`.
7. On a `reset` input, the state machine transitions to the `IDLE` state and `shift_ena` is set to `1'b1`.

The module now correctly implements the desired behavior of asserting `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and keeping it deasserted otherwise.'}
