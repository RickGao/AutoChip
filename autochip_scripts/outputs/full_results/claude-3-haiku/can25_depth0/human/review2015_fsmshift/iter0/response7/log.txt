The corrected Verilog module handles the requested functionality as follows:

1. The module has three states: IDLE, ACTIVE, and DONE.
2. When the reset signal is asserted, the module enters the IDLE state and sets `shift_ena` to 1 for 4 cycles.
3. In the ACTIVE state, the module continues to assert `shift_ena` until it has been active for 4 cycles.
4. Once the 4 cycles have elapsed, the module enters the DONE state and keeps `shift_ena` at 0 until the next reset.
5. The state machine transitions between the states based on the current state and the number of cycles that `shift_ena` has been asserted.

This implementation ensures that the shift register is enabled for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then keeps `shift_ena` deasserted until the next reset.'}
