The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Added a reg `shift_ena` to hold the output signal.
2. Added a `localparam` to define the number of cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. Added a state machine to control the enable signal.
4. In the main `always` block:
   - Initialized the state to 0 and `shift_ena` to 1 on reset.
   - Transitioned the state on each clock cycle.
   - Asserted `shift_ena` when the state is 0 and reset is not active.
   - Deasserted `shift_ena` when the state reaches the `WAIT_CYCLES - 1`.
5. Added a separate `always` block to define the next state logic.

This module should now correctly enable the shift register for 4 clock cycles whenever the system is reset, and then keep it disabled until the next reset.'}
