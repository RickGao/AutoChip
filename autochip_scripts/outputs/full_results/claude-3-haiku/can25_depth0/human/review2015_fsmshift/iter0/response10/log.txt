The module has been corrected as follows:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output signal.
2. Defined the state machine with three states: `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE`.
3. Implemented the state machine logic in the `always` block that updates the `state`, `count`, and `shift_ena` signals based on the current state and the `reset` signal.
4. Defined the next state logic in the `always` block that determines the next state based on the current state and the `reset` signal.
5. Asserted `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles when the state machine is in the `SHIFT` state, and deasserted it when the state machine is in the `IDLE` or `DONE` state.

The module now correctly implements the specified functionality.'}
