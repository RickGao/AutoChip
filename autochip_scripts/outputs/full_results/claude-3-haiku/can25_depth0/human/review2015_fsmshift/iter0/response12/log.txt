This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The module has three states:

1. `IDLE`: In this state, `shift_ena` is set to 0 and the module waits for the `reset` signal to be asserted.
2. `SHIFT`: In this state, `shift_ena` is set to 1 and the module counts for 4 clock cycles. After 4 cycles, the module transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
3. `RESET`: In this state, `shift_ena` is set to 1 and the module waits for the `reset` signal to be deasserted, then transitions to the `IDLE` state.

The module uses a 2-bit state register to keep track of the current state, and a case statement to handle the state transitions. The module ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the `reset` signal is asserted, and is deasserted afterwards until the next reset.'}
