The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Added a state machine with three states: IDLE, SHIFT, and DONE.
2. Added a counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles the shift register needs to be enabled.
3. In the IDLE state, the shift_ena output is set to 1'b1, and the state transitions to SHIFT if the counter is less than 3, or to DONE if the counter is 3.
4. In the SHIFT state, the shift_ena output is set to 1'b1, and the state transitions to DONE when the counter reaches 0.
5. In the DONE state, the shift_ena output is set to 1'b0, and the state transitions back to IDLE on a reset.
6. The reset is handled synchronously, with the state and counter reset to their initial values.'}
