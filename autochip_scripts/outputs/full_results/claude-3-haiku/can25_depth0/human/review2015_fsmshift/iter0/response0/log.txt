The module has been completed as per the provided specification. The key points are:

1. The `shift_ena` output is declared as a `reg` type to allow it to be updated in the `always` block.
2. The `count` register is used to keep track of the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted.
3. When `reset` is high, `count` is initialized to `ASSERT_SHIFT_ENA` (4) and `shift_ena` is asserted.
4. In the subsequent cycles, if `count` is greater than 0, `count` is decremented, and `shift_ena` remains asserted.
5. Once `count` reaches 0, `shift_ena` is deasserted (set to 0) until the next reset.

This ensures that whenever the FSM is reset, `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
