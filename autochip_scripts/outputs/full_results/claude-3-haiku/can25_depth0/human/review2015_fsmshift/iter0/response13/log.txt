The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared a `state` register and `next_state` wire to keep track of the current and next state of the FSM.
2. Defined a `ENABLE_CYCLES` parameter to specify the number of cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. In the first `always` block:
   - Initialized the `state` register to 0 on reset.
   - Asserted `shift_ena` to 1 when the module is reset.
   - Transitioned to the next state and deasserted `shift_ena` when the state reaches `ENABLE_CYCLES - 1`.
4. In the second `always` block:
   - Implemented the state machine logic to transition between states and control the value of `shift_ena`.

This module will assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then keep it deasserted until the next reset.'}
