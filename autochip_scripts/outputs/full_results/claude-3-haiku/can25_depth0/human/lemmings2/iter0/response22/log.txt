{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

The provided Verilog module implements the Lemming state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following key features:

1. It uses a single-bit state variable `state` to represent the Lemming's walking direction, with `WALK_LEFT` represented as 1 and `WALK_RIGHT` represented as 0.
2. The `always` block handles the state updates and output assignments based on the input signals (`bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`) and the current state.
3. When `areset` is high, the module resets the state to `WALK_LEFT` and initializes the output signals accordingly.
4. When `ground` is high, the module sets the walking direction and `aaah` output based on the current state.
5. When `ground` is low, the module sets `walk_left` and `walk_right` to 0, and `aaah` to 1, indicating that the Lemming is falling.
6. The module updates the `state` based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` signals, switching the walking direction when the Lemming is bumped.

The provided module should correctly implement the Lemming state machine as per the given requirements.'}
