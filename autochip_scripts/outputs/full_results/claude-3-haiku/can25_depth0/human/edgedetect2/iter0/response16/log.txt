The Verilog module you provided is correct and should work as expected. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_prev` register holds the previous value of the `in` input signal.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   a. The current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev`.
   b. The `anyedge` output is assigned the result of the XOR operation between the current `in` and the previous `in_prev` values. This effectively detects any bit that has changed from the previous cycle.

The module will correctly detect any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) for each bit in the 8-bit `in` vector and set the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output.'}
