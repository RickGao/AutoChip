The corrected Verilog module contains the following:

1. The `out_assign` output is assigned using the Verilog `assign` statement, which implements the XOR operation between `a` and `b`.

2. The `out_always_comb` output is assigned inside a combinational `always` block, which also implements the XOR operation between `a` and `b`.

3. The `out_always_ff` output is assigned inside a clocked `always` block, which implements the XOR operation between `a` and `b` and stores the result in a flip-flop. This means that the output will be delayed by one clock cycle compared to the other two XOR implementations.'}
