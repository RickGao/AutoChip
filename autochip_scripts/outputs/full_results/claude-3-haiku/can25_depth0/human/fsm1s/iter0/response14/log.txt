This Verilog module implements a Moore state machine with two states, one input, and one output. The reset state is B and reset is active-high synchronous.

The module has the following functionality:

1. The state register `state` is used to keep track of the current state, with `A` representing state A and `B` representing state B.
2. The `out` output is assigned the appropriate value based on the current state.
3. On each positive edge of the clock signal `clk`:
   - If `reset` is high, the state is set to `B`.
   - Otherwise, the next state is determined based on the current state and the input `in`:
     - If the current state is `B`, and `in` is 0, the next state is `A`; if `in` is 1, the next state remains `B`.
     - If the current state is `A`, and `in` is 0, the next state is `B`; if `in` is 1, the next state remains `A`.

The completed Verilog module correctly implements the given state machine specification.'}
