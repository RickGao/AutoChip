```

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the given circuit specification. The key components are:

1. A two-input XOR gate that takes the input `in` and the output `out` of the D flip-flop.
2. A positive edge-triggered D flip-flop that uses the output of the XOR gate as its D input, and the input `clk` to trigger the update of the output `out`.

The `always_ff` block is used to implement the D flip-flop, which updates the output `out` on the positive edge of the `clk` signal with the value of the XOR gate output `xor_out`.'}
