{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Implement in Verilog the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as input the output of a two-input XOR.

endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements the given circuit. The key points are:

1. The XOR gate is implemented using the `^` operator to take `in` and the current `out` value as inputs and assign the result to `xor_out`.
2. The D flip-flop is implemented using an `always_ff` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk`. The `out` signal is assigned the value of `xor_out` on each positive clock edge.
3. There is no reset signal, as per the given specification.'}
