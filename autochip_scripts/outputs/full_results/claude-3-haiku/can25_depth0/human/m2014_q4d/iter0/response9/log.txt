endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements the given circuit:

1. The `xor_out` signal is assigned the result of the XOR operation between the `in` input and the `out` output.
2. The D flip-flop is implemented using the `always_ff` block, which triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` input. The `out` output is assigned the value of `xor_out` on each positive clock edge.

The module is complete and should compile without any errors.'}
