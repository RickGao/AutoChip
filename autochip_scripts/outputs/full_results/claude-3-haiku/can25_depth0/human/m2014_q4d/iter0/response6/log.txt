{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Implement in Verilog the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as input the output of a two-input XOR.

module top_module (

    end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements the given circuit as follows:

1. The `xor_output` signal is defined to hold the output of the two-input XOR gate, which takes `in` and `out` as inputs.
2. The D flip-flop logic is implemented inside the `always_ff` block, which is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal. On each positive edge, the `out` signal is updated with the value of `xor_output`.
3. There is no reset signal in the given specification, so the D flip-flop does not have a reset functionality.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the specified circuit.'}
