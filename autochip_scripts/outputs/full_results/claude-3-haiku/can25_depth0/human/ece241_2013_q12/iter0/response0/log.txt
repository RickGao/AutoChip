{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

    input B,
    input C,
    output reg Z

            default: Z = 1'bx;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

The module has the following features:

1. 8-bit shift register implemented using 8 D-type flip-flops, with the output labeled `Q[7:0]`.
2. Shift input `S` is connected to the input of the most significant bit `Q[0]`.
3. The shift register is enabled by the `enable` signal.
4. The 3-input logic function is implemented using a case statement, where the output `Z` is assigned the value of the corresponding bit in the shift register `Q[7:0]` based on the input values `A`, `B`, and `C`.
5. If the input combination `{A, B, C}` does not match any of the valid cases, the output `Z` is set to `1'bx` (don't care).

This module provides the required functionality of an 8x1 memory with shift-in writing and random-access reading, as well as the 3-input logic function.'}
