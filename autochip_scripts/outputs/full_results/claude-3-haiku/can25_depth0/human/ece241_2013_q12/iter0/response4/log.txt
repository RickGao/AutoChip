{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous active-high enable signal, and a multiplexer to select the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the input signals A, B, and C.

The key features are:

1. The 8-bit shift register is implemented using a single 8-bit register `Q`, with the input `S` being shifted into the most significant bit (Q[7]) on each enabled clock cycle.
2. The multiplexer logic is implemented using a `case` statement, which selects the appropriate bit from the `Q` register based on the input signals `A`, `B`, and `C`. The output `Z` is assigned the selected bit value.
3. The `default` case in the `case` statement assigns `Z` to `1'bx` to handle any invalid input combinations.

This circuit can be used to realize a 3-input logic function, where the input bits `S` are shifted into the 8-bit shift register, and the output `Z` is selected based on the 3-bit input `ABC`.'}
