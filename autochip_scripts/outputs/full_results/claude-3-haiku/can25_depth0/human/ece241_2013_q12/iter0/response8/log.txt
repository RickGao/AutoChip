{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous enable signal, and a 3-to-8 decoder to select the appropriate bit from the shift register to output as `Z` based on the `A`, `B`, and `C` inputs.

The key components are:

1. The 8-bit shift register `Q` that shifts in the input `S` on the positive edge of `clk` when `enable` is high.
2. The 3-to-8 decoder `address` that generates a one-hot encoded address based on the `A`, `B`, and `C` inputs.
3. The output logic that selects the appropriate bit from the shift register `Q` based on the decoded address and assigns it to the output `Z`.

This circuit can be used to implement the 3-input logic function as described in the problem statement.'}
