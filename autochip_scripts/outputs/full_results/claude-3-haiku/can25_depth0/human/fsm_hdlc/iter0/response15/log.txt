{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The main changes are:

1. Made the output signals `disc`, `flag`, and `err` as `reg` types to allow assignment within the always block.
2. Corrected the state transitions and output logic to match the given specifications.
3. Ensured that the reset state behaves as if the previous input was 0 by initializing the state to `WAIT`.

The FSM now correctly recognizes the three sequences:
1. `0111110`: Asserts `disc` signal for one cycle.
2. `01111110`: Asserts `flag` signal for one cycle.
3. `01111111...`: Asserts `err` signal for one cycle.'}
