{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences described in the problem statement:

1. **0111110**: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output)
2. **01111110**: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output)
3. **01111111...**: Error (7 or more consecutive 1s) (`err` output)

The FSM has eight states, representing the number of consecutive 1s detected:
- `IDLE`: 0 consecutive 1s
- `ONE`: 1 consecutive 1
- `TWO`: 2 consecutive 1s
- `THREE`: 3 consecutive 1s
- `FOUR`: 4 consecutive 1s
- `FIVE`: 5 consecutive 1s
- `SIX`: 6 consecutive 1s
- `SEVEN`: 7 or more consecutive 1s

The next state logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input bit (`in`). The output logic is implemented in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, which sets the appropriate output signals based on the current state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the FSM is reset to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` input is high.'}
