{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences as specified in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (`disc` output).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (`flag` output).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (`err` output).

The module has four states:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for the input to become `1`.
- `DISC`: Detected 5 consecutive `1`s, waiting for the next bit to determine if it's a discarded bit or a flag.
- `FLAG`: Detected a flag (`01111110`), resetting the state machine.
- `ERROR`: Detected 7 or more consecutive `1`s, indicating an error.

The `next_state` logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the state on the next clock cycle based on the current state and the input value. The output signals (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the corresponding condition is detected.

The module also handles the reset signal, which sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state as if the previous input were `0`.'}
