{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences as specified in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: This is the initial state, where the FSM waits for the input to become 1.
2. `DISC`: This state is entered when the FSM detects 5 consecutive 1s, indicating that a bit needs to be discarded.
3. `FLAG`: This state is entered when the FSM detects 6 consecutive 1s, indicating the beginning or end of a frame.
4. `ERR`: This state is entered when the FSM detects 7 or more consecutive 1s, indicating an error.

The module updates the state and output signals based on the current state and the input value. The reset signal is handled synchronously, and the output signals are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.'}
