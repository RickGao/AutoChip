{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The corrected Verilog module implements the required HDLC framing logic using a Moore-type finite state machine. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three output signals: `disc`, `flag`, and `err` which are asserted for one clock cycle when the corresponding conditions are detected.
2. The module has a reset signal which sets the state machine to the `STATE_INIT` state, which behaves as if the previous input was 0.
3. The state machine has six states: `STATE_INIT`, `STATE_ONE`, `STATE_TWO`, `STATE_THREE`, `STATE_FOUR`, and `STATE_FIVE`, `STATE_SIX` which correspond to the detection of the different bit patterns.
4. The state transitions are implemented using a combinational logic block that updates the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `in`.
5. The output signals `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are set in the combinational logic block based on the current state and the input `in`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the HDLC framing logic as described in the problem statement.'}
