The provided Verilog module implements the 2's complementer using a Mealy machine with one-hot encoding. The module has the following functionality:

1. The module has four ports: `clk` (clock input), `areset` (asynchronous active-high reset input), `x` (input signal), and `z` (output signal).
2. The module uses two registers: `state` and `next_state`, where `state` holds the current state of the Mealy machine and `next_state` holds the next state.
3. The module has two states: `A` and `B`, represented by 2-bit one-hot encoding.
4. The module resets to state `A` when `areset` is high.
5. The state transition logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the `next_state` based on the current `state` and the input `x`.
6. The output `z` is also generated in the `always @(*)` block, based on the current `state` and the input `x`.

The provided Verilog module is correct and should compile without any issues.'}
