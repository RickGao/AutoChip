The Verilog module implementation for the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding and asynchronous active-high reset is as follows:

1. The module has four ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The `state` register is defined as a 2-bit vector, with the states A and B represented as 2'b01 and 2'b10, respectively.
3. The `always` block handles the state transitions. On a positive edge of `clk` or when `areset` is high, the state is updated.
   - If `areset` is high, the state is set to A.
   - Otherwise, the state transitions based on the current state and the value of `x`.
   - If the current state is A and `x` is 0, the state remains A.
   - If the current state is A and `x` is 1, the state transitions to B.
   - If the current state is B, the state remains B regardless of the value of `x`.
   - If the state is not A or B, the state is set to A.
4. The `z` output is assigned based on the current state and the value of `x`. If the state is A, `z` is equal to `x`. If the state is B, `z` is equal to the negation of `x`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding and asynchronous active-high reset.'}
