The provided Verilog module is a correct implementation of the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. It has the following features:

1. The module has a reset input `areset` that resets the state to `A` asynchronously.
2. The module has a state register `state` and a next state register `next_state` to hold the current and next state of the Mealy machine.
3. The `state` register is updated on the positive edge of the clock `clk`, and the `next_state` is determined based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The output `z` is assigned based on the current state and the input `x`.
5. The module has the required state transitions as per the provided diagram:
   - If the current state is `A` and `x` is 0, the next state is `A` and `z` is 0.
   - If the current state is `A` and `x` is 1, the next state is `B` and `z` is 1.
   - If the current state is `B` and `x` is 0, the next state is `B` and `z` is 1.
   - If the current state is `B` and `x` is 1, the next state is `B` and `z` is 0.

The module is complete and should compile and function correctly.'}
