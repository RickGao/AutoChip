The provided Verilog code implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding. The module has the following features:

1. The module has four ports: `clk` (clock input), `areset` (asynchronous active-high reset input), `x` (input to the Mealy machine), and `z` (output of the Mealy machine).
2. The module uses two-bit state variables `state` and `next_state` to represent the current and next states of the Mealy machine, respectively.
3. The state parameter names are defined as `A` and `B`.
4. The `always` block for the state register updates the `state` register based on the asynchronous reset signal `areset`. If `areset` is high, the state is set to `A`. Otherwise, the state is updated to the next state `next_state`.
5. The `always` block for the next state logic and output calculation uses a `case` statement to determine the next state and output `z` based on the current state and input `x`.
6. In state `A`, if `x` is 1, the next state is `B`, and the output `z` is set to `x`. If `x` is 0, the next state remains `A`, and the output `z` is set to `x`.
7. In state `B`, the next state remains `B`, and the output `z` is set to the complement of `x`.
8. The default case is used to handle any unexpected states, where the next state is set to `A`, and the output `z` is set to 0.

This Verilog module correctly implements the 2's complementer Mealy machine using one-hot encoding, with the reset behavior and state transitions as specified in the problem statement.'}
