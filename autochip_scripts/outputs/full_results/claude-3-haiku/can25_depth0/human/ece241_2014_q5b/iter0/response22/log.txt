The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given Mealy machine specification using one-hot encoding. It has the following features:

1. The module takes in `clk`, `areset`, and `x` as inputs, and produces `z` as the output.
2. The module uses two states, `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`, to represent the Mealy machine states.
3. The state transitions are handled in the `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. The output `z` is determined in the `always @(*)` block, based on the current state and the input `x`.
5. The module resets to `STATE_A` when `areset` is high, which is the desired behavior.

The module should compile and function correctly according to the given Mealy machine specification.'}
