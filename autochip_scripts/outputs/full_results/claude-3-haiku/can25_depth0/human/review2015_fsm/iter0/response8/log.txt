{'role': 'user', 'content': '// We want to create a timer that:\n// (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n// In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog code implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specification. It has the following key features:

1. The state machine has 6 states: IDLE, DETECT_PATTERN, SHIFT_DURATION, COUNTING, NOTIFY_USER, and WAIT_ACK.
2. In the IDLE state, the state machine monitors the input data and detects the start pattern of 1101.
3. When the start pattern is detected, the state machine transitions to the DETECT_PATTERN state and asserts the `shift_ena` output.
4. In the SHIFT_DURATION state, the state machine shifts in 4 more bits from the input data to determine the duration of the timer.
5. The state machine then transitions to the COUNTING state, asserts the `counting` output, and waits for the `done_counting` input to be high, indicating the counters have finished.
6. Once the counting is done, the state machine transitions to the NOTIFY_USER state, asserts the `done` output, and waits for the `ack` input to be high, indicating the user has acknowledged the timer.
7. The state machine resets to the IDLE state upon receiving the `ack` input, ready to detect the next start pattern.
8. The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to IDLE and clears the outputs when the `reset` input is high.

The provided Verilog code should correctly implement the required finite-state machine for the timer.'}
