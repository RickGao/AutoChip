The above Verilog code implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer based on the given specification. The state machine has four states:

1. `WAIT_START`: This state waits for the start sequence "1101" to be detected on the `data` input.
2. `SHIFT_COUNT`: After the start sequence is detected, this state shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration of the timer.
3. `WAIT_DONE`: This state waits for the counters to finish counting down the timer duration.
4. `NOTIFY_USER`: This state notifies the user that the timer has timed out and waits for the user to acknowledge it.

The state machine uses the `shift_count` register to keep track of the number of bits shifted in and the current state. The `shift_ena` output is asserted during the `SHIFT_COUNT` state to enable the data path to shift in the bits. The `counting` output is asserted during the `WAIT_DONE` state to indicate that the counters are running. The `done` output is asserted during the `NOTIFY_USER` state to notify the user that the timer has timed out.

The state machine has a synchronous reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START` when the `reset` input is high.'}
