This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine for the timer as described in the problem statement. It has the following states:

1. `SEARCH`: Searches for the 1101 pattern on the `data` input.
2. `SHIFT`: Shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay.
3. `COUNT`: Waits for the counters to finish counting.
4. `NOTIFY`: Notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

The module uses a reset signal to initialize the state machine to the `SEARCH` state, and a synchronous reset to reset the state machine to the `SEARCH` state. The `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` outputs are asserted and deasserted based on the current state of the state machine.'}
