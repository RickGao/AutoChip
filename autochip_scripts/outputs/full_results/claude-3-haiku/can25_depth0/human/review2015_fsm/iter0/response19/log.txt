The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specifications. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: This is the initial state where the module waits for the input pattern `1101` to be detected.
2. `DETECT_PATTERN`: In this state, the module continues to shift in the input bits and checks if the pattern `1101` has been completely received.
3. `SHIFT_DURATION`: Once the `1101` pattern is detected, the module shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration of the timer.
4. `WAIT_COUNTING`: After the duration is set, the module asserts the `counting` output and waits for the `done_counting` input to go high, indicating that the timer has finished counting.

The module also has the following outputs:
- `shift_ena`: Enables the shifting in of the input bits during the `DETECT_PATTERN` and `SHIFT_DURATION` states.
- `counting`: Indicates that the timer is currently counting.
- `done`: Notifies the user that the timer has timed out, and waits for the `ack` input to be asserted before resetting to the `IDLE` state.

The module also has a synchronous reset input `reset` that sets the state to the `IDLE` state and resets the internal variables.'}
