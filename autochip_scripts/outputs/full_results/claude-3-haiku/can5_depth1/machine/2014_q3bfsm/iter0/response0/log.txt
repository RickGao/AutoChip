The provided Verilog module specification describes a finite state machine with five states (A, B, C, D, and E) and an input `x` that controls the state transitions. The output `z` is high when the state is D or E.

The corrected Verilog module implementation includes the following:

1. Defined the state register `state` with a 3-bit width to represent the 8 possible states.
2. Defined the state constants `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` using the `localparam` keyword.
3. Implemented the state transition logic in the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the negation of the reset signal.
4. Inside the state transition logic, used a `case` statement to handle the state transitions based on the current state and the input `x`.
5. Implemented the output logic in the second `always` block, where the output `z` is set high when the state is D or E, and low otherwise.

This corrected Verilog module should compile and function as per the given specification.'}
