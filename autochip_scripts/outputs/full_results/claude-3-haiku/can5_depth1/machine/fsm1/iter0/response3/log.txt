The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `out` signal is declared as a `reg` type, as it needs to be updated in the always block.
2. The `state` variable is declared as a `reg` type and is used to store the current state of the state machine.
3. The `parameter` statement is used to define the state values `A` and `B`.
4. The `always` block is used to update the state and the output based on the current state and the input signal `in`.
5. Inside the `always` block, the first `if` statement checks for the asynchronous reset signal `areset` and sets the state to `B` and the output `out` to 0.
6. The `case` statement is used to handle the state transitions based on the current state and the input signal `in`.
7. When the state is `A`, if the input `in` is high, the next state remains `A` and the output `out` is set to 0. If the input `in` is low, the next state becomes `B` and the output `out` is set to 0.
8. When the state is `B`, if the input `in` is high, the next state remains `B` and the output `out` is set to 1. If the input `in` is low, the next state becomes `A` and the output `out` is set to 0.'}
