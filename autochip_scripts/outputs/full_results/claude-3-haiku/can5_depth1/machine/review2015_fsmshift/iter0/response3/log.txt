This module implements the given state machine with the following features:

1. The state register is a 3-bit register that can hold the values 0 to 4, representing the states B0 to Done.
2. The state transition logic is implemented in the first always block, which updates the state on the positive edge of the clock or the reset signal.
   - If reset is 1, the state is set to B0 (3'b000).
   - Otherwise, the state transitions from B0 to B1, B1 to B2, B2 to B3, and B3 to Done (3'b100).
   - If the state is not B0 to B3, it is set to Done.
3. The shift_ena output is determined in the second always block, which sets it to 1 when the state is B0 to B3, and 0 when the state is Done.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the given state machine specification.'}
