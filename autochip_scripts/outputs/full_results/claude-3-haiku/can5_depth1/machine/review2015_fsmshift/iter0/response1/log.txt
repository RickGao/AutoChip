The code above implements the Verilog module as per the given specification. The key points are:

1. A 3-bit state register `state` to represent the 5 states (B0, B1, B2, B3, Done).
2. In the first `always` block, the state transitions are implemented based on the reset signal and the current state.
3. In the second `always` block, the `shift_ena` output is set based on the current state.
4. If the state is not B0, B1, B2, or B3, it is considered the Done state.
5. If the reset is 1, the state is always set to B0.'}
