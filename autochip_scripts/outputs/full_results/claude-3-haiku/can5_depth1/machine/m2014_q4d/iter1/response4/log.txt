module top_module (

end

endmodule

The issue with the initial module was that the output `out` was not properly initialized. By default, Verilog variables are initialized to an unknown value (`x`), which can lead to unexpected behavior during simulation.

In the corrected module, the `out` signal is declared as a `logic` type, which is automatically initialized to 0 when the module is instantiated. This ensures that the initial state of the output is always 0, as required by the specification.'}
