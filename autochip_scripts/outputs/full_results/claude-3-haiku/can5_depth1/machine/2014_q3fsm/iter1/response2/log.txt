The main changes are:

1. In the `next_state` logic, the state transition from `A` to `A` when `s` is not asserted was missing.
2. In the `next_state` logic, the state transition from `S20` to `B` was missing.

These changes should resolve the simulation errors and ensure the module behaves according to the specified state machine.'}
