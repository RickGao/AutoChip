{'assistant': 'Apologies for the error in the previous module. Here's the corrected version:

module top_module(

    reg [4:0] q_next;

    // State transition logic

    always @(posedge clk) begin

        else
            q <= q_next; // Assign q with q_next
    end

endmodule

The issues in the previous module were:

1. The assignment of `q_next[4:1]` was incorrect. It should be `q[3:0]` instead of `q[4:1]`.
2. The XOR operation was performed on `q_next[2]` instead of `q[2]`.

These changes should fix the issues you encountered in the simulation. The updated module should now pass the testbench without any errors.'}
