The Verilog module you provided is correct and should work as expected. It implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous, and it resets the counter to 0.

The module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). Inside the block, it checks if the reset signal (`reset`) is high. If it is, the counter value (`q`) is set to 4'b0000 (0 in binary). Otherwise, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 4'd9 (9 in decimal). If it is, the counter is reset to 4'b0000 (0 in binary). If the current value of `q` is not 9, the counter is incremented by 1.'}
