The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (synchronous reset input), and `q` (4-bit output).
2. The module uses a single `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter value `q` is reset to 0.
   - If the `reset` input is low, the counter value `q` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `q` is 9, it is reset to 0, otherwise, it is incremented.
4. The module correctly implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets the counter to 0 on a synchronous high reset input.'}
