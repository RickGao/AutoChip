The provided Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous, and it resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block updates the counter value `q` on every positive edge of the clock. If the reset input is high, the counter is set to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1, unless it has reached the maximum value of 9, in which case it is reset to 0.'}
