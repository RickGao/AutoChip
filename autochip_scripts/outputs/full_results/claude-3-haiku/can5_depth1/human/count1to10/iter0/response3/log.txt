The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive, with a synchronous reset input that resets the counter to 1.

The key elements of the module are:

1. The input `clk` is used to drive the counter on the positive edge.
2. The input `reset` is used to reset the counter to 1 when it is high.
3. The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current count value.
4. The `always` block updates the counter value on the positive edge of `clk`:
   - If `reset` is high, the counter is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, if the current count `q` is equal to 10, the counter is reset to 1.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 1 to 10, inclusive, and resets to 1 when the `reset` input is high.'}
