{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the Lemmings state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: clock signal
- `areset`: asynchronous reset signal
- `bump_left`: signal indicating a left bump
- `bump_right`: signal indicating a right bump
- `ground`: signal indicating the presence of ground

Outputs:
- `walk_left`: signal indicating the Lemming is walking left
- `walk_right`: signal indicating the Lemming is walking right
- `aaah`: signal indicating the Lemming is falling and saying "aaah!"

The module uses a single state register `state` to track the Lemming's current state, which can be either `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT`. The state is updated based on the input signals and the current state, following the behavior described in the problem statement.

Upon reset (`areset`), the Lemming is set to the `WALK_LEFT` state. In the `WALK_LEFT` state, the Lemming will continue walking left unless it is bumped on the right, in which case it will switch to the `WALK_RIGHT` state. Similarly, in the `WALK_RIGHT` state, the Lemming will continue walking right unless it is bumped on the left, in which case it will switch to the `WALK_LEFT` state.

When the `ground` signal is 0, the Lemming will set the `aaah` output to 1, indicating that it is falling. When the `ground` signal becomes 1 again, the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.'}
