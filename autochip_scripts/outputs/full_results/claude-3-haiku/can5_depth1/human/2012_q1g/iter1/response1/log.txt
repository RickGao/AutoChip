The issue with the previous code was the use of concatenation to form the case statement condition. The Verilog compiler was unable to handle that, and was instead including all bits in the case statement, leading to the warnings. By using the input port `x` directly in the case statement, the issue is resolved, and the module should now compile without any warnings.'}
