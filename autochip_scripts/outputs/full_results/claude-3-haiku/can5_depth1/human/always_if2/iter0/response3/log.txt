The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. In the first `always` block, the `shut_off_computer` output was not assigned a value when `cpu_overheated` was false. This has been corrected by adding an `else` statement to assign `0` to `shut_off_computer`.

2. In the second `always` block, the condition for `keep_driving` was incorrect. The condition should be `!arrived` (not arrived) instead of `~arrived` (arrived). Additionally, when `arrived` is true, `keep_driving` should be set to `0`.

The corrected module now handles all the cases correctly.'}
