The main changes are:

1. I've added a statement to set `start_shifting` to 1 when the state machine enters the `FOUND` state, and keep it at 1 until the reset signal is asserted.
2. In the `SEARCH` state, I've added a transition back to the `SEARCH` state to ensure the state machine continues searching for the 1101 sequence.

This should fix the issues reported in the simulation output.'}
