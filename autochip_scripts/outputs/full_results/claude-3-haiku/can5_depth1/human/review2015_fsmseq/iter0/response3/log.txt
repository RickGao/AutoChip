The provided Verilog module is a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence `1101` in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to `1`, which remains high until the `reset` signal is asserted.

The module has three states:
1. `IDLE`: The initial state, where the module checks the incoming `data` bits to see if they match the `1101` sequence.
2. `SEARCH`: The state where the module is actively searching for the `1101` sequence.
3. `FOUND`: The state where the `1101` sequence has been detected, and the `start_shifting` output is set to `1`.

The module uses a 4-bit shift register `shift_reg` to keep track of the incoming data bits. The state transitions are handled in the `always @(*)` block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the contents of the shift register.

When the `reset` signal is asserted, the module resets the state to `IDLE`, sets `start_shifting` to `0`, and clears the shift register.'}
