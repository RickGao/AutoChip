This Verilog module captures the change of each bit in a 32-bit input vector `in` from 1 to 0 over consecutive clock cycles. The output `out` is a 32-bit vector, where each bit remains set to 1 until the entire module is reset using the `reset` signal.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `in_prev` register stores the previous value of the input `in`, allowing the module to detect changes from 1 to 0.
2. The `out` register is updated on each clock cycle using the bitwise OR operation between the current `out` value and the result of `~in & in_prev`, which captures the 1-to-0 transitions.
3. The `reset` signal is used to synchronously reset the `out` register to 0.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the desired functionality.'}
