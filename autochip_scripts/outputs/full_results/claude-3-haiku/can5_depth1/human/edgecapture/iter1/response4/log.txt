```

The issue with the previous implementation was that the `out` signal was being updated based on the current `in` value, instead of the previous `in_prev` value. By storing the previous input value in `in_prev` and using that to detect the 1 to 0 transition, the module now correctly captures the desired edge events.

The key changes are:

1. Added a register `in_prev` to store the previous input value.
2. Updated the logic in the `always` block to use `in_prev` instead of `in` to detect the 1 to 0 transition.
3. Initialized `out` and `in_prev` to 0 on reset.

This should resolve the issues reported in the testbench output.'}
