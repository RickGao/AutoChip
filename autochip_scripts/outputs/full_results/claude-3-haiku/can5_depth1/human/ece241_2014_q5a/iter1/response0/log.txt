The main changes are:

1. Initialized the `z` output to 0 in the reset condition.
2. Added a `count` register to keep track of the number of bits processed, and updated the `next_state` logic to transition to the `DONE` state after 8 bits have been processed.
3. Changed the assignment of `z` to only output the 2's complement result when the state is `DONE`, and to output 0 in all other states.

These changes should resolve the reported mismatches in the simulation.'}
