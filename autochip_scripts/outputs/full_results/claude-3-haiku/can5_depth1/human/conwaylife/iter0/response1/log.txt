{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

The provided Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module takes a clock signal `clk`, a `load` signal to load the initial state, and a `data` input that represents the initial state. The current state of the grid is stored in the `q` output.

The module has two main parts:

1. The `always` block that handles the state update:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the `data` input.
   - Otherwise, the current state `q` is updated with the next state `next_state`.

2. The `always` block that calculates the next state `next_state`:
   - It iterates over all 256 cells in the grid.
   - For each cell, it calculates the number of neighboring cells that are alive.
   - Based on the current state of the cell and the number of neighbors, the next state is determined according to the rules of the Game of Life.

The module correctly implements the Game of Life rules, taking into account the toroidal nature of the 16x16 grid.'}
