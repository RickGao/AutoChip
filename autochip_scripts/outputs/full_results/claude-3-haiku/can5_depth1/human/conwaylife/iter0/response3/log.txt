{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

This Verilog module implements the rules of the Game of Life as described in the problem statement. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `load` to load the initial state, an input `data` to provide the initial state, and an output `q` that represents the current state of the game.

The module uses a combinational logic block to calculate the next state of the game based on the current state and the number of neighbors for each cell. The logic for counting the neighbors and applying the game rules is implemented in the `always @(*)` block.

The sequential logic in the `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the current state `q` based on the `load` signal and the calculated next state.'}
