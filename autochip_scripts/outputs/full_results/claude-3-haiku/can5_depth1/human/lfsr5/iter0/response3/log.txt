The provided Verilog module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, as per the given specification. The module has the following features:

1. The `q` register is a 5-bit wide register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. If the `reset` signal is active, the `q` register is initialized to `5'b00001`, which is the non-zero initial state required for a maximal-length LFSR.
4. If the `reset` signal is not active, the LFSR is updated as follows:
   - The bits in `q[4:1]` are shifted one position to the right, effectively shifting the LFSR.
   - The new value for `q[0]` is computed by XORing `q[4]` and `q[2]`, which corresponds to the taps at bit positions 5 and 3.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the specified 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR.'}
