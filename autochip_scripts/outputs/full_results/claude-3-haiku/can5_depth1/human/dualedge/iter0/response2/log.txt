The provided solution uses a combination of `always @(posedge clk, negedge clk)` and an `if (clk)` condition to achieve the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. This is necessary because FPGAs do not natively support dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` construct is not a valid Verilog sensitivity list.

The `always @(posedge clk, negedge clk)` block ensures that the flip-flop's behavior is triggered on both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal. The `if (clk)` condition within the block updates the output `q` with the input `d` on both the positive and negative clock edges.

This approach effectively simulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available FPGA resources, which only support single-edge triggered flip-flops.'}
