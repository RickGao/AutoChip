The provided module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of positive and negative edge-triggered logic. The module uses two separate always blocks to capture the data on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

In the first always block, the input data `d` is captured on the positive edge of the clock and stored in the `q` register. Additionally, the inverted data `~d` is stored in the `q_neg` register.

In the second always block, the `q` register is updated with the value from the `q_neg` register on the negative edge of the clock. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered behavior, where the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.

This approach allows the module to behave like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not natively support such a construct.'}
