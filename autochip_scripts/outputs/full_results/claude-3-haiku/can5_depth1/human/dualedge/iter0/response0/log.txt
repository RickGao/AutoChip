The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a single-edge triggered flip-flop. The key aspects are:

1. The input signal `d` is captured in the register `d_reg` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The output `q` is then updated with the value of `d_reg` on the same positive edge of the clock.

This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered behavior, as the output `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, even though the flip-flop itself is only triggered on the positive edge.

This approach works around the limitation that FPGAs do not have direct support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` construct is not accepted as a legal sensitivity list.'}
