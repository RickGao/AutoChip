This implementation uses two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and one triggered on the negative edge. The final output `q` is then derived by ORing the outputs of the two flip-flops, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior.

The key steps are:

1. Declare two additional internal registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` to hold the values captured on the positive and negative clock edges.
2. Use separate `always` blocks to update `q_pos` and `q_neg` on the positive and negative clock edges respectively.
3. Use a third `always` block to drive the final output `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg`.

This combination of positive and negative edge-triggered flip-flops, coupled with the final OR logic, provides the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
