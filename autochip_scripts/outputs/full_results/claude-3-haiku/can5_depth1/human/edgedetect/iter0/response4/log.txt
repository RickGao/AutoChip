This Verilog module implements the requested functionality. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_d` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` input signal.
2. In the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`), the current value of `in` is stored in `in_d`.
3. The `pedge` output is then calculated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` value and the inverse of the previous `in_d` value (`in & ~in_d`). This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit of the 8-bit vector.
4. The resulting `pedge` output will have a bit set to 1 in the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs in the corresponding bit of the `in` input.'}
