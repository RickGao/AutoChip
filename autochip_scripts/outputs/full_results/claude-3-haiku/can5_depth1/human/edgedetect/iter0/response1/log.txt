The provided Verilog module correctly implements the specified functionality. The module has an 8-bit input signal `in`, an 8-bit output signal `pedge`, and a clock input `clk`.

The module uses a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the `in` signal. In each clock cycle, the current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev`, and the output `pedge` is calculated as the bitwise AND of the current `in` signal and the negated previous `in_prev` signal. This effectively detects the 0-to-1 transitions for each bit in the 8-bit vector.'}
