The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

endmodule
```

The main changes are:

1. Added a new register `duration` to store the 4-bit duration value.
2. Updated the `STATE_SHIFT_DURATION` case to shift the duration value.
3. Corrected the condition in `STATE_SHIFT_DURATION` to check if `duration` is 0 instead of `pattern`.

This should resolve the issues with the previous module and pass the testbench.'}
