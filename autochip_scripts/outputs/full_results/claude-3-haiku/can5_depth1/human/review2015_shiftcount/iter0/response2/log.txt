The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the above code is the completed Verilog module that implements the required functionality.

The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal.
2. The input `shift_ena` controls the shifting of data into the shift register. When `shift_ena` is 1, the new data is shifted in from the most significant bit (MSB) of the `q` register.
3. The input `count_ena` controls the decrementing of the counter. When `count_ena` is 1, the value in the `q` register is decremented by 1.
4. The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the shift register and counter.
5. The `always` block checks the values of `shift_ena` and `count_ena` on the positive edge of the clock signal and performs the corresponding operation (shifting or decrementing) on the `q` register.

This Verilog module should compile and work as specified.'}
