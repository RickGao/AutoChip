{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. Added a `reg done` output to signal when a complete 3-byte message has been received.
2. Defined the state and count registers to keep track of the current state and the number of bytes received.
3. Implemented the state machine logic in the `always` block. The state machine has the following states:
   - `0`: Waiting for the first byte of the message (where `in[3]` should be 1).
   - `1`: Received the first byte, waiting for the second and third bytes.
   - `2`: Received all three bytes, signal `done` and reset the state machine.
4. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, resetting the state machine to the initial state and clearing the `done` signal.

This FSM-based implementation correctly identifies the start and end of each 3-byte message in the input byte stream.'}
