{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes four inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `load` (a synchronous active-high load signal), `data` (a 512-bit input representing the initial state of the cells), and `q` (a 512-bit output representing the current state of the cells).

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. If the `load` signal is high, the module loads the input `data` into the `q` register.

4. If the `load` signal is low, the module updates the state of the cells according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell (`q[0]`) is updated with the value of the second cell (`q[1]`).
   - For all other cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is calculated based on the current state of the cell and its two neighbors, following the Rule 110 logic.
   - The last cell (`q[511]`) is updated with the value of the second-to-last cell (`q[510]`).

This implementation assumes that the boundary cells (before the first cell and after the last cell) are both 0 (off).'}
