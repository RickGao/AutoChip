This Verilog module represents a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting the register.
- `L`: The load signal, which is asserted when the register should load the value from `R`.
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop in the current stage.

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. The behavior of the module is as follows:

1. If the `L` signal is asserted, the module loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop, storing it in the output `Q`.
2. If the `E` signal is asserted, the module shifts the value from the input `w` into the flip-flop, storing it in the output `Q`.
3. If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the module maintains the current value in the flip-flop, storing it in the output `Q`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified n-bit shift register circuit.'}
