This Verilog module implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. It has the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: The clock signal
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: The value to load when `L` is asserted
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting
- `L`: The load signal, when asserted, loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop

The module uses a single always block to update the state of the flip-flop `Q`. If the load signal `L` is asserted, the value from `R` is loaded into `Q`. Otherwise, if the enable signal `E` is asserted, the value from `w` is loaded into `Q`.'}
