The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The clock is incremented by a fast-running `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal indicates when the clock should increment (once per second). The `reset` signal resets the clock to "12:00 AM".

The module uses three 8-bit registers (`hh`, `mm`, `ss`) to store the hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively. The `pm` signal is used to indicate whether the time is AM or PM.

The module updates the clock as follows:
1. If `reset` is high, the clock is reset to "12:00 AM".
2. If `ena` is high, the seconds are incremented. When the seconds reach 59, the minutes are incremented, and when the minutes reach 59, the hours are incremented. When the hours reach 12, the AM/PM indicator is toggled.

The module ensures that the clock correctly handles the transition from 11:59 PM to 12:00 AM, and the transition from 12:59 PM to 1:00 PM.'}
