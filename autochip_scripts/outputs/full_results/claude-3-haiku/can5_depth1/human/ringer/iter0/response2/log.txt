{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Suppose you are designing a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor. Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call (input ring), your circuit must either turn on the ringer (output ringer = 1) or the motor (output motor = 1), but not both. If the phone is in vibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn on the ringer.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput ring, \n\tinput vibrate_mode,\n\toutput ringer,\n\toutput motor\n);"}
{'assistant': 'Here is the completed Verilog module for the given specification:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input ring, 
    input vibrate_mode,
    output reg ringer,
    output reg motor
);

always @(*) begin
    if (vibrate_mode) begin
        ringer = 1'b0;
        motor = 1'b1;
    end
    else begin
        ringer = ring;
        motor = ~ring;
    end
end

endmodule
```

The key points are:

1. Declared the outputs `ringer` and `motor` as `reg` to allow for continuous assignment.
2. Used a combinational `always @(*)` block to implement the logic.
3. If `vibrate_mode` is high, set `ringer` to 0 and `motor` to 1.
4. If `vibrate_mode` is low, set `ringer` to the value of `ring` and `motor` to the opposite of `ring`.

This ensures that either the ringer or the vibration motor is active, but not both, based on the input conditions.'}
