The provided Verilog module correctly implements the specified functionality. It takes two 8-bit 2's complement numbers `a` and `b` as inputs, and computes their sum `s` and whether an overflow has occurred (`overflow`).

The key steps are:

1. Extend `a` and `b` to 9-bit values by adding a leading 0 (`{1'b0, a}` and `{1'b0, b}`). This allows the addition to be performed without truncating the most significant bit.
2. Add the extended 9-bit values using the `+` operator, resulting in a 9-bit `sum`.
3. Assign the lower 8 bits of `sum` to the output `s`.
4. Determine if an overflow has occurred by checking if the most significant bit of `sum` (bit 8) is different from the sign bit of the result (bit 7). This is done using the `!=` operator, and the result is assigned to the `overflow` output.

This Verilog module should compile and function correctly.'}
