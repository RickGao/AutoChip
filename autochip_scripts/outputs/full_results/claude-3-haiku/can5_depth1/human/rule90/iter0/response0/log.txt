{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. Here's how it works:

1. The module has four ports:
   - `clk`: The clock input.
   - `load`: The signal to load the initial state from the `data` input.
   - `data`: The 512-bit input data to be loaded.
   - `q`: The 512-bit output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. The module uses an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If the `load` signal is high, the module loads the initial state from the `data` input into the `q` register.
4. If the `load` signal is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]`, as per the Rule 90 boundary condition.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0, as per the Rule 90 boundary condition.
   - For all other cells `q[i]`, where `1 <= i < 511`, the new state is set to the XOR of the left and right neighbors, `q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`, respectively.

This implementation correctly advances the 512-cell system by one time step each clock cycle, as per the given specification.'}
