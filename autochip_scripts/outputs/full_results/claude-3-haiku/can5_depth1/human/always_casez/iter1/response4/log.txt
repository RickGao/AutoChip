The issue with the previous implementation was that it used a sequential `case` statement, which meant that it would only report the first `1` bit encountered, even if there were multiple `1` bits in the input. 

In the corrected version, we use a combinational `case` statement that checks each bit position individually and assigns the corresponding value to `pos`. This ensures that the output correctly represents the position of the first `1` bit in the input.'}
