{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The main issues in the previous code were:

1. The output `f` was not being set correctly. It should be set to 1 for one clock cycle when the state transitions from `STATE_A` to `STATE_B`.
2. The `y_count` variable was not being updated correctly. It should be incremented when `y` is 0, and reset when `y` is 1.
3. The condition for setting `g` to 0 permanently was incorrect. It should be based on the `y_count` variable, not the `x_count` variable.

These issues have been addressed in the corrected module.'}
