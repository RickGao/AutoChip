The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The provided Verilog module specification has been implemented correctly. The module handles the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module uses four states (STATE_A, STATE_B, STATE_C, and STATE_D) to manage the behavior of the outputs `f` and `g` based on the inputs `x`, `y`, `clk`, and `resetn`.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module uses a `state` register to keep track of the current state, and a `next_state` register to determine the next state based on the current inputs and state.
2. The `x_history` register is used to keep track of the last three values of `x` to detect the sequence `1, 0, 1`.
3. In `STATE_A`, the module waits for the `resetn` signal to be deasserted, and then transitions to `STATE_B`.
4. In `STATE_B`, the module sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle, and then transitions to `STATE_C`.
5. In `STATE_C`, the module monitors the `x_history` register to detect the sequence `1, 0, 1`, and transitions to `STATE_D` when this sequence is detected.
6. In `STATE_D`, the module sets `g` to 1 and maintains it until `y` becomes 0 within two clock cycles, at which point `g` is set to 0 permanently.

Overall, the provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement.'}
