The provided Verilog code implements the given finite state machine circuit. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` has two inputs, `clk` and `x`, and one output, `z`.
2. It declares three internal registers, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`, to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
3. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). Inside the block:
   - `q1` is updated with the XOR of the input `x` and the current value of `q1`.
   - `q2` is updated with the AND of the input `x` and the complemented current value of `q2`.
   - `q3` is updated with the OR of the input `x` and the current value of `q3`.
4. The output `z` is assigned the result of a three-input XNOR gate, where the inputs are `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.

This Verilog code correctly implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
