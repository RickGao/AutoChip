The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

```

The main changes are:
1. Moved the `w_count` and `z` update logic inside the `case (state)` block to ensure correct behavior based on the current state.
2. Simplified the `always @(*)` block to use a more straightforward state transition logic.

These changes should fix the issues observed in the simulation and pass the testbench.'}
