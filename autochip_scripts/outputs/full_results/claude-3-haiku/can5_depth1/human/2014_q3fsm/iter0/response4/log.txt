The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. It uses three states:

1. `STATE_A`: This is the initial reset state, where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, the FSM transitions to `STATE_B`.
2. `STATE_B`: In this state, the FSM checks the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w = 1` in exactly two of these clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
3. `STATE_C`: This state is used to count down the three clock cycles in `STATE_B` where the `w` input is checked. Once the count reaches 0, the FSM transitions back to `STATE_B`.

The module uses a `w_count` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles where `w = 1` in `STATE_B`. The `z` output is set accordingly based on the value of `w_count`.

The `always` blocks handle the state transitions, output assignments, and the `w_count` update logic. The module uses the minimum number of states required to implement the specified finite state machine.'}
