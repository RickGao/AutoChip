The provided Verilog code implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine. The key features are:

1. The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. The next state logic is defined in the first `always` block, which updates the `next_state` variable based on the current state and the input `in`.
3. The output `out` is also determined in the first `always` block based on the current state.
4. The second `always` block updates the current state `state` register based on the `next_state` and the synchronous active high reset signal `reset`.
5. The state machine resets to state A when the `reset` signal is high.

This implementation should compile and function correctly according to the provided state transition table.'}
