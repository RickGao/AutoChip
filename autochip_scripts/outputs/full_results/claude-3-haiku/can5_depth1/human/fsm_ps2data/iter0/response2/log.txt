{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that searches for the start of a message in the input byte stream, and then stores the subsequent 3 bytes into the `out_bytes` register. The `done` signal is asserted in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message is received.

The module has the following states:

1. `2'b00`: Searching for the start of the message. The module waits until it sees a byte with `in[3]` set to 1, which indicates the start of a new message. When this happens, the first byte is stored in `byte1` and the state moves to the next state.
2. `2'b01`: Received the first byte. The second byte is stored in `byte2` and the state moves to the next state.
3. `2'b10`: Received the second byte. The third byte is stored in `byte3`, and the complete 24-bit message is assembled in `out_bytes_reg`. The `done` signal is also asserted and the state returns to the initial state.

The `out_bytes` and `done` outputs are registered to ensure that they are valid in the cycle immediately after the third byte of the message is received.'}
