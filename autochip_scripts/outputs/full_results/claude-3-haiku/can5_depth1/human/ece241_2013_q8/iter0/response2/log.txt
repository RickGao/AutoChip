The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge-triggered asynchronous reset signal `aresetn`.

The FSM has three states:
1. `IDLE`: The initial state, waiting for the sequence to start.
2. `DETECT_0`: Detecting the first '0' in the sequence.
3. `DETECT_1`: Detecting the '1' after the '0' in the sequence.

The state transitions and output logic are implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which evaluates the next state and output based on the current state and input `x`. The `always @(posedge clk, negedge aresetn)` block handles the state updates and asynchronous reset.

This implementation correctly recognizes overlapping sequences, as the FSM will transition back to the `DETECT_0` state after detecting the '1' in the sequence, allowing it to detect the next '101' sequence.'}
