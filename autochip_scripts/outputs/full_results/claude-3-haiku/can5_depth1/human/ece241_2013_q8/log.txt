system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Implement a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named x. Your FSM should have an output signal, z, that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. Your FSM should also have a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset. You may only have 3 states in your state machine. Your FSM should recognize overlapping sequences.
