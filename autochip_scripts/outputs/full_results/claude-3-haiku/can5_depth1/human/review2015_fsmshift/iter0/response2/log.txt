The provided Verilog code is correct and should work as expected. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `shift_ena`.
2. The `RESET_CYCLES` parameter is set to 4, which determines the number of cycles the `shift_ena` signal should be asserted after a reset.
3. The `cycle_count` register is used to keep track of the number of cycles since the reset.
4. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
5. If `reset` is `1`, the `shift_ena` signal is set to `1` and the `cycle_count` is reset to `0`.
6. If `reset` is `0` and `cycle_count` is less than `RESET_CYCLES - 1`, the `shift_ena` signal is kept at `1` and the `cycle_count` is incremented.
7. If `reset` is `0` and `cycle_count` is equal to `RESET_CYCLES - 1`, the `shift_ena` signal is set to `0` and the `cycle_count` is reset to `0`.

This module ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the `reset` signal is asserted, and then remains `0` until the next reset.'}
