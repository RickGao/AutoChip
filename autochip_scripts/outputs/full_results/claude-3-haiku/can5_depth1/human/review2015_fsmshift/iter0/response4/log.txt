The key changes made to the original module are:

1. Declared the `shift_ena` signal as a `reg` type output, as it needs to be assigned a value inside the always block.
2. Added a state machine with two states: `IDLE` and `SHIFT`.
3. In the `SHIFT` state, assert `shift_ena` to 1'b1 and keep it high for 4 clock cycles, then transition to the `IDLE` state and keep `shift_ena` at 0 forever.
4. In the `IDLE` state, keep `shift_ena` at 0.
5. Added a `default` case to handle any undefined states and reset the state machine to the `IDLE` state with `shift_ena` at 0.

This implementation ensures that whenever the `reset` signal is asserted, the FSM enters the `SHIFT` state and asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles, then transitions to the `IDLE` state and keeps `shift_ena` deasserted.'}
