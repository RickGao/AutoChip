The module you provided is mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `shift_ena` output should be a registered output (`reg` type) instead of a combinational output.
2. The state machine logic should be updated to handle the reset signal correctly.

The corrected module is shown above. The key changes are:

- Declared `shift_ena` as a `reg` type output.
- Implemented the state machine logic to handle the reset signal. When the reset signal is asserted, the module goes to the `IDLE` state, sets `shift_ena` to `1'b1`, and sets the count to 4.
- In the `SHIFT` state, the module decrements the count until it reaches 0, at which point it transitions to the `DONE` state and sets `shift_ena` to `1'b0`.
- In the `DONE` state, the module maintains `shift_ena` at `1'b0` until the next reset.

This should provide the desired functionality of asserting `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keeping it deasserted until the next reset.'}
