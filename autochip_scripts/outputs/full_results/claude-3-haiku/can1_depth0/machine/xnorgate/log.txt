system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This module is a simple two-input, one-output logic circuit. It takes two inputs, a and b, and produces an output, out. The output is the logical negation of the exclusive-or (XOR) of the two inputs. This means that the output will be true (1) when the inputs are not equal and false (0) when the inputs are equal. The module is implemented using a single assign statement, which assigns the output to the logical negation of the XOR of the two inputs.

module top_module(
	input a, 
	input b,
	output out
);
assistant: module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    output out
);

assign out = ~(a ^ b);

endmodule
