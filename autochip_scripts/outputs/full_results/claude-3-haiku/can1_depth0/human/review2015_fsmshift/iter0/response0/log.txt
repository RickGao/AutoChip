The corrected Verilog module provides the desired functionality. It uses a state machine with two states:

1. Initial state (state = 0): When the module is reset, it sets the `shift_ena` signal to 1 and increments a counter up to `COUNTER_MAX` (4). Once the counter reaches 4, it transitions to the next state.

2. Idle state (state = 1): In this state, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 0, and the counter is reset to 0. The module remains in this state until the next reset occurs.

The module correctly asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles when the reset signal is asserted, and then keeps it deasserted until the next reset.'}
