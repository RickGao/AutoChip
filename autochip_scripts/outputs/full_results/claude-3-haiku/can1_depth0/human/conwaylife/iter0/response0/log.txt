{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

This Verilog module implements the Conway's Game of Life simulation on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `load` signal is used to load the initial state of the grid into the `q` register. On every clock cycle, the module calculates the number of neighbors for each cell using the current state `q`, and then updates the state of each cell based on the rules of the game.

The module uses a 2D representation of the grid, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a 16-bit sub-vector of the 256-bit `q` register. The `neighbors` array is used to store the number of neighbors for each cell, which is then used to update the state of the cell according to the rules of the game.

The module correctly implements the Conway's Game of Life simulation on a 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
