The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The key changes made to the original code are:

1. Added state machine logic to handle the different states of the timer control state machine.
2. Introduced state variables to track the current and next state.
3. Handled the transition between states based on the input signals and the shift count.
4. Implemented the desired outputs (shift_ena, counting, done) based on the current state.
5. Ensured a synchronous reset that sets the state machine to the initial state (STATE_IDLE).

This implementation should correctly implement the timer control state machine as described in the problem statement.'}
