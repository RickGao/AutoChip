This Verilog module takes a 16-bit `scancode` input and sets the corresponding output signal (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) based on the value of the scancode. The module uses a `case` statement to check the value of the `scancode` input and sets the appropriate output signal to 1. If the `scancode` does not match any of the four cases, no output signal is asserted.'}
