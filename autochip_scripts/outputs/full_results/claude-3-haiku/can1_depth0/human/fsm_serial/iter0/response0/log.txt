{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following functionality:

1. The module has four states: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, and `STOP`.
2. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. In the `START` state, the module verifies that the start bit is present. If it is, the module transitions to the `DATA` state. If not, the module transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
4. In the `DATA` state, the module samples the 8 data bits and stores them in the `data_reg` register.
5. In the `STOP` state, the module checks for the presence of the stop bit (1). If the stop bit is present, the `done` output is set high, and the module transitions back to the `IDLE` state. If the stop bit is not present, the module transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
6. The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine and the `data_reg` register.

The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, and the module is designed to handle this correctly.'}
