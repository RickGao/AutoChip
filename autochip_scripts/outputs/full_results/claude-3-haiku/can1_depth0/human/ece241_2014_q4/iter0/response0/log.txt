The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the following components:

1. `top_module`: This is the main module that instantiates the D flip-flops and the XNOR gate.
2. `dff`: This is a module that implements a D flip-flop with complementary outputs.

In the `top_module`, the three D flip-flops are connected as follows:
- The first flip-flop `d1` takes the input `x` XORed with its own output `q1` as the data input.
- The second flip-flop `d2` takes the input `x` ANDed with the complement of its own output `q2_bar` as the data input.
- The third flip-flop `d3` takes the input `x` ORed with the complement of its own output `q3_bar` as the data input.

The outputs of the three flip-flops are then connected to a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is assigned to the `z` output of the `top_module`.

The `dff` module implements a D flip-flop with complementary outputs `q` and `q_bar`. The flip-flop updates its state on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement.'}
