The corrected Verilog module performs the following operations:

1. Declares a 9-bit wire `sum` to hold the result of the addition.
2. Assigns the sum of the signed 8-bit numbers `a` and `b` to `sum` using the `$signed()` function to interpret the inputs as 2's complement signed numbers.
3. Assigns the lower 8 bits of `sum` to the output `s`.
4. Computes the overflow condition by checking if the most significant bit of `sum` (`sum[8]`) is different from the sign bit of the result (`sum[7]`). This is assigned to the `overflow` output.

The key aspects are:
- Using `$signed()` to interpret the 8-bit inputs as signed numbers.
- Performing the addition in a 9-bit wire to accommodate the potential overflow.
- Checking the overflow condition by comparing the most significant bit with the sign bit of the result.'}
