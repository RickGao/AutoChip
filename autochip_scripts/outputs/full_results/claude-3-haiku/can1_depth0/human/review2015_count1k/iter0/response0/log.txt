This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. Inside the block, the module first checks if the `reset` signal is high. If so, it resets the counter `q` to 0.

If `reset` is not high, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 999. If so, it resets `q` back to 0, effectively wrapping around the counter. Otherwise, it increments `q` by 1.

The output `q` is a 10-bit wide register that holds the current value of the counter.'}
