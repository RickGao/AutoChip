{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Defined the states of the finite state machine: `WAIT_FOR_HEADER`, `RECEIVE_BYTE1`, `RECEIVE_BYTE2`, and `RECEIVE_BYTE3`.
2. Introduced an internal state register `state` to keep track of the current state of the FSM.
3. Included a byte counter `byte_count` to track the number of bytes received in the current message.
4. Implemented the state machine logic in the `always` block, which handles the state transitions and sets the `done` output signal.
5. Ensured that the `done` signal is set to 1 in the cycle immediately after the third byte of the message is received.
6. Reset the state machine and clear the `done` signal when the `reset` input is active.

This corrected Verilog module should correctly implement the specified PS/2 mouse protocol message detection algorithm.'}
