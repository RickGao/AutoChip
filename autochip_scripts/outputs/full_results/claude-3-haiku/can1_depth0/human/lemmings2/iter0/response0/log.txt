{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.

The provided Verilog module correctly models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the specification. The module uses a Moore state machine to represent the Lemming's state, which can be either walking left or walking right. The module responds to the input signals `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground` to update the Lemming's state and output signals accordingly.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module uses a single-bit state register `state` to represent the Lemming's current state, with `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT` as the two possible states.
2. The `always` block handles the state transitions and output updates based on the current state and input signals.
3. When the Lemming is walking left or right, the module sets the corresponding `walk_left` or `walk_right` output to 1, and the other output to 0.
4. When the ground disappears (`ground = 0`), the module sets the `aaah` output to 1 to indicate that the Lemming is falling.
5. When the ground reappears (`ground = 1`), the module resets the `aaah` output to 0, allowing the Lemming to resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.
6. The asynchronous reset signal `areset` is used to initialize the Lemming's state to walking left.

The provided Verilog module should correctly implement the Lemmings game behavior as specified.'}
