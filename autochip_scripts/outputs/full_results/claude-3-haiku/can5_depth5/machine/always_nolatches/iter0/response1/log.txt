The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module takes a 16-bit `scancode` input and produces four output signals: `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up`.
2. Inside the `always` block, the outputs are first initialized to 0.
3. Then, a `case` statement is used to check the value of the `scancode` input and set the corresponding output to 1 based on the provided conditions.
   - If the `scancode` is 16'he06b, the `left` output is set to 1.
   - If the `scancode` is 16'he072, the `down` output is set to 1.
   - If the `scancode` is 16'he074, the `right` output is set to 1.
   - If the `scancode` is 16'he075, the `up` output is set to 1.

This Verilog module correctly implements the functionality described in the specification.'}
