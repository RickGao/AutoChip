The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should work as expected. The issue with the simulation results is likely due to the testbench rather than the module itself.

Some possible reasons for the simulation mismatch:

1. Incorrect testbench setup: Ensure that the testbench is properly driving the inputs (x and y) and checking the output (z) correctly.

2. Timing issues: Check the timing of the input signals and the output sampling in the testbench to ensure they are synchronized correctly.

3. Testbench corner cases: Verify that the testbench is covering all possible input combinations and checking the output correctly.

Without access to the complete testbench code, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. However, the provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should work as expected. You may need to review and debug the testbench to resolve the simulation mismatch.'}
