The corrected Verilog module implements the given Mealy machine specification. The key changes are:

1. In the `if (a)` block, `q` is assigned the value `3'b100`, which is 4 in decimal.
2. In the `else if (q == 3'b110)` block, `q` is assigned the value `3'b000`, which is 0 in decimal.
3. In the `else` block, `q` is incremented by `1'b1`, which is 1 in decimal.

This ensures that the output `q` behaves according to the given specification.'}
