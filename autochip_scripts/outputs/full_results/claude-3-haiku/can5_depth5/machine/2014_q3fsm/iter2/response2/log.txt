The main issues with the original module were:

1. The state transition from S20 should be back to state A, not state B.
2. The output z should be high (1'b1) in states S20, S21, and S22, and low (1'b0) in all other states.

The corrected module addresses these issues, and should now pass the provided testbench.'}
