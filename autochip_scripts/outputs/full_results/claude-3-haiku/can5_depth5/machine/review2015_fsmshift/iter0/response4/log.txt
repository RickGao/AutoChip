The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Defined the state parameters as localparam for better readability and maintainability.
2. Added a state register to hold the current state of the state machine.
3. In the reset condition, the state is set to B0.
4. In the state update logic, the next state is updated based on the current state, transitioning from B0 to B1, B1 to B2, B2 to B3, and B3 to DONE.
5. In the output logic, the `shift_ena` signal is set to 1 when the state is B0, B1, B2, or B3, and 0 otherwise.

This corrected module should behave as per the given specification.'}
