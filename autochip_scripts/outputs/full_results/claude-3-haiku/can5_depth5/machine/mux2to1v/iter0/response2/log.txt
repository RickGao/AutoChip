The provided Verilog module is correct and does not have any compilation errors. It implements a simple 1-bit multiplexer that selects between two 100-bit wide input signals `a` and `b` based on the value of the select signal `sel`. If `sel` is `0`, the output `out` is assigned the value of `a`, and if `sel` is `1`, the output `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

The `always @(*)` block ensures that the output `out` is updated immediately whenever any of the input signals (`a`, `b`, or `sel`) change. The `case` statement handles the two possible values of `sel` and assigns the corresponding value to `out`. The `default` case is included to handle any unexpected value of `sel`.'}
