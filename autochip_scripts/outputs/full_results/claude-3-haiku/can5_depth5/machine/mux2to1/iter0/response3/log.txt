The provided Verilog module is mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `out` port should be declared as a `reg` type, as it is being assigned a value inside the `always` block.
2. The `always` block should use the `@(*)` construct to make it a combinational logic block, as the output depends on the inputs.
3. The `case` statement should handle the default case, where `sel` is not 0 or 1, by assigning `out` to an unknown value (`1'bx`).

With these corrections, the Verilog module should now work as intended.'}
