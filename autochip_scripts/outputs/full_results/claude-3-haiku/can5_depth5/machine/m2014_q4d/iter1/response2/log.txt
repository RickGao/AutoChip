The issue with the provided Verilog module was that the output `out` was not initialized to 0 before the `always_ff` block. This caused the initial value of `out` to be unknown, leading to the mismatch in the simulation.

To fix this, we can add an initial block to set the initial value of `out` to 0:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input in,
    output logic out
);

initial begin
    out = 1'b0;
end

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= out ^ in;
end

endmodule
```

This should resolve the issue and the simulation should run without any mismatches.'}
