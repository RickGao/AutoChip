This Verilog module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999 on the positive edge of the clock. The reset input resets the counter to 0, and the counter automatically resets to 0 when it reaches 999.

The key aspects of the module are:

1. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`@(posedge clk)`).
2. The `if` statement checks for the reset condition. If reset is active, the counter is set to 0 (`q <= 0`).
3. The `else if` statement checks if the counter has reached 999 (`q == 10'd999`). If so, the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 0`).
4. The `else` statement increments the counter by 1 (`q <= q + 1`).

This module should compile and function correctly as a 10-bit counter from 0 to 999.'}
