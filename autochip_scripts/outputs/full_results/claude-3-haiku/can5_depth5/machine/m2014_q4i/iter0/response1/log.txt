```

The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. Declared the `out` port as a `reg` (register) type output, as it needs to be assigned a value in the `initial` block.
2. In the `initial` block, assigned the `out` port to the binary value `1'b0`, which represents a single-bit binary 0.

This ensures that the output port `out` is correctly assigned the desired constant value of 0 when the module is instantiated and executed.'}
