The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown in the corrected module above. The key points are:

1. Declare a state register `state` to keep track of the current state.
2. Define the state parameters `STATE_A` and `STATE_B` using `localparam`.
3. Use a `case` statement in the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of `clk` and `areset` to update the state based on the input `in`.
4. Use another `always` block to assign the output `out` based on the current state.

The state machine transitions correctly based on the input `in`, and the output `out` is high when the state is `STATE_B` and low otherwise.'}
