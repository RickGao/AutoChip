The provided Verilog module code appears to be correct. The issue likely lies in the testbench or the simulation setup. Here are a few things to consider:

1. Check the testbench code to ensure that the input stimuli are being correctly generated and applied to the module under test.
2. Verify that the expected output values are being calculated correctly in the testbench.
3. Ensure that the simulation is running for a sufficient duration to capture the complete behavior of the module.
4. Check for any timing-related issues or race conditions that may be causing the mismatches.

Without seeing the full testbench code, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. However, the provided Verilog module code appears to be correct and should function as expected.'}
