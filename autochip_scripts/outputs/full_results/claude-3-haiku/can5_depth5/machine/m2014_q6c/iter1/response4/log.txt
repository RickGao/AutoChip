module top_module (
    input [6:0] y,

    output Y4
);

assign Y2 = y[0] & ~w;
assign Y4 = y[1] & y[2] & y[4] & y[5] & w;

endmodule

The key changes are:
1. The input port `y` is declared as a 7-bit vector `[6:0]` to match the specification.
2. The assignment for `Y2` uses `y[0]` instead of `y[1]` to get the first bit of `y`.
3. The assignment for `Y4` uses `y[1]`, `y[2]`, `y[4]`, and `y[5]` to get the second, third, fifth, and sixth bits of `y`.

This should fix the issues and pass the testbench.'}
