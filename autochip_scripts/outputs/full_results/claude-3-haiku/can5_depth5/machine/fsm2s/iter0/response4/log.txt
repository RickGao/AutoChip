The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. Declare a `state` register to keep track of the current state (A or B).
2. Use a `parameter` to define the state values (A = 0, B = 1).
3. Use an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the reset signal to update the state.
   - If `reset` is high, set the state to A.
   - Otherwise, update the state based on the current state and the inputs `j` and `k`.
4. Use a separate `always` block to assign the output `out` based on the current state.

This implementation correctly captures the state machine behavior described in the module specification.'}
