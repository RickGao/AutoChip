The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

The module takes an 8-bit input signal `in` and assigns it to the 8-bit output signal `out` in reversed order. This is achieved using the concatenation operator `{}` to rearrange the bits of `in` in reverse order.

The line `assign out = {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};` takes each bit of the input `in` in reverse order (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit) and assigns them to the corresponding bits of the output `out`.'}
