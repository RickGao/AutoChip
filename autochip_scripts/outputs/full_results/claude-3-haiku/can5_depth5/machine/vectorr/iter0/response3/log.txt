The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has two ports: an 8-bit input `in` and an 8-bit output `out`.
2. The output `out` is assigned by directly connecting each bit of `in` to the corresponding bit of `out` in reverse order. This effectively reverses the bits of the input `in`.
3. The `assign` statements connect each bit of `out` to the corresponding bit of `in` in reverse order, such that `out[0]` is assigned the value of `in[7]`, `out[1]` is assigned the value of `in[6]`, and so on.

This Verilog module implements the desired functionality of reversing the bits of the 8-bit input `in` and outputting the result in `out`.'}
