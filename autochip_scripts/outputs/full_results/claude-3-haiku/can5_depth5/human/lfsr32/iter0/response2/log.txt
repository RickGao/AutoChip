The provided Verilog module specification defines a 32-bit Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The module has a synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1`.

The implementation of the module is as follows:

1. The module has two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (active high synchronous reset).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 32-bit register that holds the current state of the LFSR.
3. Inside the `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), the module checks the `reset` input:
   - If `reset` is high, the output `q` is set to `32'h1`.
   - If `reset` is low, the next state of the LFSR is calculated by shifting the current state left by one bit (`q[30:0]`) and XORing the leftmost bit (`q[31]`) with the bits at positions 22, 1, and 0 (`q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]`). The result is then assigned to `q`.

This implementation correctly implements the 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps and reset behavior.'}
