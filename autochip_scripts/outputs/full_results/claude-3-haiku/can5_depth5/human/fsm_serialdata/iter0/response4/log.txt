{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The module has the following features:

1. It detects the start bit, waits for all 8 data bits, and then verifies the stop bit.
2. If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM waits until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
3. The correctly received data byte is output on the `out_byte` port when the `done` signal is asserted.
4. The module includes a synchronous active-high reset.
5. The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

The module has five states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit.
2. `START_BIT`: Verifies the start bit.
3. `DATA_BITS`: Shifts in the data bits.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifies the stop bit and outputs the data byte.
5. `WAIT_STOP`: Waits for the stop bit if it was not found when expected.

The `next_state` logic transitions the FSM between these states based on the current state and the value of the `in` input.'}
