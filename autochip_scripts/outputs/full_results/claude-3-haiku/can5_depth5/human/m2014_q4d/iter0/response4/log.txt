```

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the given circuit. It consists of the following components:

1. **XOR Gate**: The XOR gate takes the input `in` and the output `out` of the D flip-flop, and assigns the result to the internal signal `xor_out`.

2. **D Flip-Flop**: The D flip-flop is positive edge-triggered by the clock signal `clk`. On each positive edge of the clock, the output `out` is updated with the value of the `xor_out` signal.

The module does not have a reset signal, as specified in the problem statement.'}
