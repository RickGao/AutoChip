{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The key changes made are:

1. Declared the state registers and states using localparam.
2. Added the state transition logic in the first always block.
3. Implemented the next state and output logic in the second always block, using a case statement to handle the different states.
4. Stored the output values `f` and `g` in output registers to ensure they are driven correctly.
5. Handled the reset condition properly, transitioning to state A when the reset is asserted.
6. Implemented the desired state machine behavior as described in the problem statement.

This Verilog module should compile and function as per the given specification.'}
