{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has four states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.
2. The `state` and `next_state` registers keep track of the current and next state of the FSM.
3. The `x_count` register keeps track of the number of successive `x` inputs with the pattern `1, 0, 1`.
4. The `always` block for the `state` register updates the state and output signals based on the current state and inputs.
5. The `always` block for the `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and inputs.

The FSM operates as follows:

1. If the `resetn` signal is low, the FSM goes to `STATE_A` and sets the outputs `f` and `g` to 0.
2. When `resetn` goes high, the FSM moves to `STATE_B`, setting `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
3. The FSM then moves to `STATE_C`, where it starts monitoring the `x` input. If `x` has the pattern `1, 0, 1` in three successive clock cycles, the FSM moves to `STATE_D` and sets `g` to 1.
4. In `STATE_D`, the FSM monitors the `y` input. If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently.
5. The FSM remains in `STATE_D` until the `resetn` signal goes low again, at which point it returns to `STATE_A`.'}
