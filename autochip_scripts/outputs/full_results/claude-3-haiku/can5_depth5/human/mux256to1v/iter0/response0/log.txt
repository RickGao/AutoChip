```

The key points are:
1. The 256 4-bit inputs are packed into a single 1024-bit input vector `in`.
2. The `sel` input is an 8-bit value that selects which 4-bit chunk of `in` to output.
3. The output `out` is assigned by slicing the appropriate 4-bit chunk from `in` based on the value of `sel`.
4. The expression `3 + 4 * sel` calculates the upper index of the 4-bit chunk, and `0 + 4 * sel` calculates the lower index.'}
