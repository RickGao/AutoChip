The provided Verilog module `top_module` is a single-stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs and output:

- `clk`: Clock signal
- `w`: Input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: Value to be loaded into the flip-flop
- `E`: Enable signal for shifting
- `L`: Load signal to load the value from `R`
- `Q`: Output of the flip-flop

The module uses a single `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The behavior of the module is as follows:

1. If the `L` signal is asserted, the flip-flop's output `Q` is set to the value of `R`.
2. If the `E` signal is asserted, the flip-flop's output `Q` is set to the value of `w`, effectively shifting the input through the register.
3. If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the flip-flop's output `Q` remains unchanged.

This module implements the desired functionality of a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit.'}
