The provided Verilog module specification describes a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs:

- `clk`: Clock signal
- `w`: Input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: Value to be loaded into the flip-flop
- `E`: Enable signal for shifting
- `L`: Load signal to load the value from `R`

The output of the module is:

- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop

The Verilog code provided in the response implements the desired functionality. The key elements are:

1. The `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
2. The `if-else` statement that checks the value of the `L` and `E` signals:
   - If `L` is 1, the value of `R` is loaded into the flip-flop `Q`.
   - If `L` is 0 and `E` is 1, the value of `w` is shifted into the flip-flop `Q`.

This implementation correctly captures the specified behavior of the n-bit shift register circuit.'}
