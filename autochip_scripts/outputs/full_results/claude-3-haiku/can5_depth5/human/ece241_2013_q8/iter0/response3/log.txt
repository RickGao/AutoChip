This Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and has 4 states.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences by transitioning to the appropriate state based on the current input and state. The `next_state` logic is defined in the second `always` block, which uses a `case` statement to determine the next state based on the current state and input. The output `z` is also determined in the second `always` block based on the current state and input.'}
