The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and only uses 3 states.

The module has the following structure:

1. Definition of the FSM states: `IDLE`, `S1`, `S2`, and `S3`.
2. State register that holds the current state of the FSM.
3. Next state logic that determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`.
4. Output logic that sets the output `z` to 1 when the FSM is in the `S3` state, indicating the detection of the "101" sequence.
5. Asynchronous reset handling that sets the state to `IDLE` when the reset signal `aresetn` is low.

This FSM correctly recognizes overlapping sequences of "101" on the input `x`.'}
