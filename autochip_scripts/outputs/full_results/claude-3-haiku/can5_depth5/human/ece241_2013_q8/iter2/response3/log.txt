The main issue with the original module was in the state transition logic. The `S1` state was transitioning to `S2` on `x` being 1, which is incorrect. The corrected module transitions from `S1` to `S0` on `x` being 1, and to `S2` only when `x` is 0, as per the problem statement.

Additionally, the output `z` is now correctly set to 1 when the "101" sequence is detected, and 0 otherwise.'}
