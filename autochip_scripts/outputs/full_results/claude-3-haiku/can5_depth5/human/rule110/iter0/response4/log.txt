{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The Verilog code above implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. 

- The `q` register stores the state of the 512 cells.
- On each clock cycle, if the `load` input is high, the state of the system is loaded with the `data` input.
- If the `load` input is low, the state of the system is advanced by one time step. This is done by shifting the existing state one cell to the right, and computing the new state of the leftmost cell based on the Rule 110 transition function.

The transition function for the leftmost cell is implemented using the boolean expression `(q[1] & q[2]) | (~q[1] & q[0]) | (q[0] & ~q[1])`, which corresponds to the truth table provided in the problem statement.'}
