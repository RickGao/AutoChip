{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton on a 512-cell system. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and an input data array `data[511:0]`. It outputs the current state of the cellular automaton in the `q[511:0]` array.

2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is loaded with the input data `data`.

4. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of the cellular automaton is calculated and stored in `q`.

5. For the first cell (`q[0]`), the next state is calculated using the formula `q[1] ^ (q[0] | q[1])`, which corresponds to the Rule 110 table.

6. For the intermediate cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is calculated using the formula `q[i-1] ^ (q[i] | q[i+1])`, which also corresponds to the Rule 110 table.

7. For the last cell (`q[511]`), the next state is calculated using the formula `q[510] ^ (q[511] | 1'b0)`. The rightmost neighbor is assumed to be 0 (off) as per the problem statement.

This implementation correctly advances the 512-cell cellular automaton by one time step per clock cycle, as per the given specification.'}
