The completed Verilog module implements the sequential circuit described in the problem statement. The circuit has a single flip-flop that stores the current state. The next state and output values are determined by the current state and the input values `a` and `b` using a case statement.

The key steps are:

1. Define two state variables: `current_state` and `next_state`.
2. Update `current_state` on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Combinationally determine the `next_state` and output `q` based on the current state and input values `a` and `b`.
4. Assign the `current_state` to the `state` output.

The behavior of the circuit can be summarized as follows:
- If `a` and `b` are both 0, the state remains unchanged and the output `q` is the current state.
- If `a` is 0 and `b` is 1, the state becomes 1 and the output `q` is the current state.
- If `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, the state becomes 0 and the output `q` is the current state.
- If `a` and `b` are both 1, the state toggles and the output `q` is the new state.

This Verilog module correctly implements the described sequential circuit behavior.'}
