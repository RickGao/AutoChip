{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous active-high enable input, and a 3-to-1 multiplexer to select the output based on the inputs `A`, `B`, and `C`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The shift register is declared as an 8-bit register `shift_register`.
2. The `always` block with the `posedge clk` condition updates the shift register. If the `enable` input is high, the shift register is shifted left by one bit, and the new MSB is assigned the value of the `S` input.
3. The second `always` block is a combinational logic block that implements the 3-to-1 multiplexer. It uses a `case` statement to select the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, and assigns it to the output `Z`.
4. If the combination of `A`, `B`, and `C` is not one of the expected values (000 to 111), the output `Z` is set to 0.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the 8x1 memory with shifting input and random access output, as well as the 3-input logic function described in the problem statement.'}
