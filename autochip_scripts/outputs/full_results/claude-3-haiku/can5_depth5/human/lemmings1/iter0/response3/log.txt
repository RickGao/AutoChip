{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The Verilog module provided correctly models the Lemmings behavior based on the given specification. The module uses a Moore state machine with two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the Lemming's walking direction. The `state` register stores the current state, and the `next_state` determines the next state based on the input signals `bump_left` and `bump_right`.

The `always` block with the posedge `clk` and `areset` updates the `state` register based on the `next_state` value. The asynchronous reset (`areset`) sets the initial state to `LEFT`.

The combinational `always` block updates the `walk_left` and `walk_right` output signals based on the current state. If the state is `LEFT`, `walk_left` is set to `1'b1` and `walk_right` is set to `1'b0`. If the state is `RIGHT`, `walk_left` is set to `1'b0` and `walk_right` is set to `1'b1`. The next state is determined based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs, switching the direction if the Lemming is bumped on the corresponding side.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified Lemmings behavior.'}
