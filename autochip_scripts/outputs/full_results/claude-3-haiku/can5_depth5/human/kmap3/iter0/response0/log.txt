The completed Verilog module implements the given Karnaugh map. The key points are:

1. The case statement covers all the combinations of inputs `c` and `d` based on the Karnaugh map.
2. For the don't-care (`d`) conditions, the output is set to the most convenient value, which in this case is `1'b0` for `cd = 01` and `1'b1` for `cd = 11` and `10`.
3. The output `out` is assigned the appropriate value based on the case statement.

This module should correctly implement the circuit described by the given Karnaugh map.'}
