The provided Karnaugh map corresponds to the boolean expression:

```
F = c'd + c'd' + cd + cd'
```

To implement this function using a 4-to-1 multiplexer and 2-to-1 multiplexers, we can use the following approach:

1. Create a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between `c` and `d` based on the value of `c`. This gives us the expression `c'd + c'd'`.
2. Create another 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between the output of the first multiplexer and `1'b1` based on the value of `d`. This gives us the expression `(c'd + c'd') + cd`.
3. Create a third 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between the output of the second multiplexer and `1'b1` based on the value of `c`. This gives us the final expression `(c'd + c'd') + cd + cd'`.
4. Connect the outputs of the three 2-to-1 multiplexers to the 4-to-1 multiplexer, with the selector inputs `a` and `b` tied to `c` and `d`, respectively.

This implementation uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers (three) and a single 4-to-1 multiplexer to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
