{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15).

This module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `get_neighbors` function calculates the number of live neighbors for a given cell, taking into account the toroidal nature of the grid. The main `always` block updates the game state every clock cycle, applying the Game of Life rules to each cell.

The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the game, and the `q` output provides the current state of the game, which is updated at every clock cycle.'}
