{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit (0).
2. `START`: Waiting for the start bit to complete.
3. `DATA`: Shifting in the 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit.
4. `STOP`: Waiting for the stop bit (1) to be received.

If the stop bit is correct, the `done` output is set high. If the stop bit is not correct, the FSM waits for the next start bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous active-high reset that resets the state, bit count, and `done` output.'}
