{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The main issue with the previous version was that the `done` signal was set on every cycle when the `STOP_BIT` state was reached, regardless of whether the stop bit was valid or not. In the corrected version, the `done` signal is only set when the stop bit is valid and the state transitions back to `IDLE`.

Additionally, the `START_BIT` state now correctly transitions back to `IDLE` if the start bit is not valid, instead of staying in the `START_BIT` state.'}
