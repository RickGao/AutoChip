The provided Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, which remains set until the `reset` input is activated.

The module has five states:
- `S0`: Initial state, waiting for a 0 to start the sequence.
- `S1`: Detected a 1 after the initial 0.
- `S2`: Detected a 1 after the 1 in `S1`.
- `S3`: Detected a 0 after the 1 in `S2`.
- `S4`: Detected a 1 after the 0 in `S3`, indicating the 1101 sequence has been found.

The `next_state` logic transitions the state machine based on the current state and the input `data`. When the `S4` state is reached, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains in this state until the `reset` input is asserted.'}
