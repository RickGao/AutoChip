The corrected Verilog module implements the specified timer functionality as follows:

1. If `load` is 1, the internal `counter` register is loaded with the value of `data`, a 10-bit input. This allows the timer to be reloaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0.

2. If `load` is 0, the `counter` register is decremented by 1 on each clock cycle, as long as it is not already 0.

3. The `tc` output signal is set to 1 when the `counter` register reaches 0, indicating that the specified duration has elapsed. Once the `counter` reaches 0, it stays at 0 until the next `load` event.

The key changes from the original code are:
- Using a `reg` type for the `tc` output to allow it to be updated in the `always` block.
- Checking if `counter` is not 0 before decrementing it, to ensure that it stays at 0 once the terminal count is reached.
- Asserting `tc` only when `counter` reaches 0, instead of keeping it asserted after that.'}
