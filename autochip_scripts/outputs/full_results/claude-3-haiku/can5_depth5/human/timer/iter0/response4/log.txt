This Verilog module implements a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles and asserts the `tc` signal when the countdown reaches 0.

The module has the following behavior:

1. If `load` is 1, the internal `counter` register is loaded with the 10-bit `data` value, and the `tc` output is reset to 0.
2. If `load` is 0, the module checks the current value of the `counter`:
   - If `counter` is greater than 0, the `counter` is decremented by 1, and `tc` is kept at 0.
   - If `counter` reaches 0, the `tc` output is set to 1 to indicate that the timer has elapsed.

Once the `counter` reaches 0, it stays at 0 until the next load operation, as per the requirement.'}
