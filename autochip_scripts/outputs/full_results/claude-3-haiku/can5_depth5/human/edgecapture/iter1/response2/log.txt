The main issues with the previous implementation were:
1. The condition `in[i] && ~in[i]` can never be true, as it's checking for a transition from 1 to 0 in the same clock cycle, which is not possible.
2. The condition `~out[i]` to set the output bit to 0 was incorrect, as it should be checking for the opposite of the current output value.

The corrected module checks for a transition from 1 to 0 in the input signal, and sets the corresponding output bit to 1 when this transition is detected. The output bit is then reset to 0 when the input transitions from 0 to 1.'}
