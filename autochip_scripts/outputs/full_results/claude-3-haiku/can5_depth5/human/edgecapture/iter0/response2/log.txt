The module correctly captures when the input signal changes from 1 to 0 for each bit in the 32-bit vector. The `always` block checks the input on the positive edge of the clock, and if the bit is 1 and the corresponding output bit is 0, it sets the output bit to 1. If the input bit is 0, it clears the output bit. The reset signal is used to clear all the output bits.'}
