{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module implements the desired finite state machine to detect the three-byte PS/2 mouse protocol message. The key points are:

1. The module has four states: `STATE_WAIT_FOR_FIRST`, `STATE_RECEIVE_FIRST`, `STATE_RECEIVE_SECOND`, and `STATE_RECEIVE_THIRD`.
2. The module starts in the `STATE_WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state, waiting for the first byte with `in[3]` set to 1.
3. Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to `STATE_RECEIVE_FIRST`, then `STATE_RECEIVE_SECOND`, and finally `STATE_RECEIVE_THIRD`.
4. In the `STATE_RECEIVE_THIRD` state, the module sets the `done` output high, indicating that a complete three-byte message has been received.
5. The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the module to the `STATE_WAIT_FOR_FIRST` state and clear the `done` output.

This implementation correctly detects the three-byte PS/2 mouse protocol message and provides the `done` signal at the appropriate time.'}
