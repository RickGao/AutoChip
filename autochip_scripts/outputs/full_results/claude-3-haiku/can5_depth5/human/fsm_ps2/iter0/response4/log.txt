{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine for the PS/2 mouse protocol as described in the problem statement. The state machine has four states: WAIT, BYTE1, BYTE2, and BYTE3.

The module takes three inputs: `clk`, `in`, and `reset`. The `in` input is an 8-bit value representing the incoming byte stream, and the `reset` input is used to reset the state machine to the WAIT state.

The `done` output is set to 1 in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message is successfully received.

The state machine works as follows:

1. In the WAIT state, the module discards bytes until it sees one with `in[7:4] == 4'b1001`, indicating the start of a new message. It then transitions to the BYTE1 state.
2. In the BYTE1 state, the module has received the first byte of the message. It then transitions to the BYTE2 state.
3. In the BYTE2 state, the module has received the second byte of the message. It then transitions to the BYTE3 state.
4. In the BYTE3 state, the module has received the third and final byte of the message. It sets the `done` output to 1 and then transitions back to the WAIT state.

If the `reset` input is active, the state machine is reset to the WAIT state, and the `done` output is set to 0.'}
