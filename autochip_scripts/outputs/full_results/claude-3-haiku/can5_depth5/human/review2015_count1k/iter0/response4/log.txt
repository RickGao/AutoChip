This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module has the following components:

1. `input clk`: The clock signal.
2. `input reset`: The active high synchronous reset signal.
3. `output reg [9:0] q`: The 10-bit counter output.

The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside the block:

1. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter `q` is set to 0.
2. If the counter `q` is equal to 999 (the maximum value), it is reset to 0.
3. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles, and that the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
