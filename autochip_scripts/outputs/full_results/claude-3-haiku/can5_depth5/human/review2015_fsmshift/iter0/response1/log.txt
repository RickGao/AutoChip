The corrected module has the following changes:

1. Declared a `shift_ena` output as a `reg` type, since it is being assigned in the always block.
2. Defined a `CYCLES` parameter to keep track of the number of clock cycles to enable the shift register.
3. Defined three states: `IDLE`, `ENABLE`, and `DONE`.
4. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to 1 to assert the enable signal for 4 cycles.
5. In the `ENABLE` state, the `shift_ena` is kept high until the `CYCLES` counter reaches 4, then the state transitions to `DONE`.
6. In the `DONE` state, the `shift_ena` is set to 0 to keep it disabled until the next reset.
7. The default case resets the state to `IDLE`.'}
