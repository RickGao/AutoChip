This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has three states: A, B, and C. 

State A is the reset state, where the FSM remains as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to state B.

In state B, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.

After the three clock cycles in state B, the FSM transitions to state C, where it continues to examine `w` for the next three clock cycles.

The `count` register is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles spent in state B and C.

The module uses a `case` statement to implement the state transitions and output logic.'}
