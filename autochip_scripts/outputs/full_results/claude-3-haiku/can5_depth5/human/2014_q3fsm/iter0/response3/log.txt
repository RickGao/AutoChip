The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has three states: STATE_A, STATE_B, and STATE_C. The state transitions and output logic are as follows:

1. In the reset state (STATE_A), the module remains in this state as long as the input `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to STATE_B.
2. In STATE_B, the module examines the value of the input `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
3. After the three clock cycles in STATE_B, the module continues to check the next three clock cycles of `w`, and the process repeats.

The module uses a `w_count` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 in the current sequence of three clock cycles.

The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the module to the initial STATE_A, set `z` to 0, and reset the `w_count` to 0.'}
