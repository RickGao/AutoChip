The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine according to the given specification. The module has three states: A, B, and C. The state transitions are as follows:

1. The module starts in state A, where it remains as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the module transitions to state B.
2. In state B, the module checks the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the module sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
3. After the three clock cycles in state B, the module transitions back to state A, regardless of the value of `w`.

The module uses a `count` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles in state B, and the `state` variable to keep track of the current state. The module also handles the reset condition, where it resets the state to A and sets `z` to 0.'}
