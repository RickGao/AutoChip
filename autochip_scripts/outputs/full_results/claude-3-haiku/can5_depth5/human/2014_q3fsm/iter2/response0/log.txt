The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The main issues with the previous version were:

1. The transition from STATE_B to STATE_C was missing. The FSM should transition back to STATE_A after checking the 3 w inputs.
2. The z output was being set to 1 in STATE_C, but it should only be set to 1 in the clock cycle after the 2 w = 1 inputs are detected.

The corrected module now correctly implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement.'}
