endmodule

This module correctly implements the given truth table. The key changes are:

1. The first term in the expression is `(x3 & ~x2 & ~x1)` to cover the case where `x3 = 1, x2 = 0, x1 = 0`.
2. The second term is `(~x3 & x2 & x1)` to cover the case where `x3 = 0, x2 = 1, x1 = 1`.
3. The third term is `(x3 & x2 & x1)` to cover the case where `x3 = 1, x2 = 1, x1 = 1`.

This should pass the given testbench.'}
