```

The issues with the original module were:

1. `next_state[5]` was incorrect. It should be `(state[4] & in) | (state[5] & ~in)`.
2. `next_state[6]` was incorrect. It should be `(state[5] & in) | (state[6] & ~in)`.
3. `next_state[7]` was incorrect. It should be `(state[6] & in) | (state[7] & ~in)`.
4. `next_state[8]` was incorrect. It should be `(state[5] & ~in) | (state[8] & ~in)`.
5. `next_state[9]` was incorrect. It should be `(state[6] & ~in) | (state[9] & ~in)`.

The rest of the logic was correct.'}
