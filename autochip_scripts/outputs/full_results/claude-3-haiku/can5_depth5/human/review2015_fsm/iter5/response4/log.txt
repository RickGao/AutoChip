The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

```

The main changes are:

1. I've added a new register `duration_count` to keep track of the shift operation for the duration.
2. In the `SHIFT_DURATION` state, the duration is shifted in 4 bits, and once the full duration is received (duration_count == 4'b1111), the shift_ena is deasserted, and the state transitions to `COUNTING`.
3. The `NOTIFY` state now correctly waits for the ack input before transitioning back to `IDLE`.

These changes should fix the timing issues and pass the testbench.'}
