After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This module implements the timer control state machine as per the given specification. The state machine has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the module waits for the input pattern 1101.
2. `DETECT_PATTERN`: The state where the module detects the input pattern 1101.
3. `SHIFT_DURATION`: The state where the module shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay.
4. `COUNT_TIMER`: The state where the module waits for the counters to finish counting.
5. `NOTIFY_USER`: The state where the module notifies the user that the timer has timed out.
6. `WAIT_ACK`: The state where the module waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

The module uses the `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` outputs to control the data path and notify the user. The `reset` input is used to synchronously reset the state machine to the `IDLE` state.'}
