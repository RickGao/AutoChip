{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

This module implements the synchronous HDLC framing state machine as described in the problem statement. It has the following states:

1. IDLE: Waiting for the first '1' input.
2. ONECOUNT: Counting the number of consecutive '1' inputs.
3. DISCARD: Discarding a '0' input after 5 consecutive '1' inputs.
4. FLAG: Detected a frame boundary (6 consecutive '1' inputs).
5. ERROR: Detected 7 or more consecutive '1' inputs.

The module uses a combination of combinational and sequential logic to transition between these states and generate the `disc`, `flag`, and `err` outputs as required.'}
