{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The corrected Verilog module provided above should correctly implement the Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences as specified in the problem statement.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The state enumeration defines the four states of the FSM: IDLE, ONE, ERROR, and DISC.
2. The next state logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input value `in`.
3. The output logic sets the appropriate output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) based on the current state.
4. The state update logic updates the state register on the positive edge of the clock, with the reset signal overriding the next state.

The module should now be able to correctly handle the specified HDLC framing requirements.'}
