This Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The module has three D flip-flops to store the current state.
2. The combinational logic gates (XOR, AND, OR) are implemented using Verilog expressions.
3. The flip-flop outputs and their complements are assigned to internal wires.
4. The D inputs of the flip-flops are driven by the combinational logic based on the input `x` and the current state.
5. The output `z` is computed as the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs.

The module should compile and function as expected based on the given circuit description.'}
