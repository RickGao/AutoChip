The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem statement. It includes the following features:

1. Declares three D flip-flops (`d1`, `d2`, and `d3`) to store the intermediate states.
2. Assigns the flip-flop outputs to the variables `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.
3. Connects the input `x` to the XOR, AND, and OR gates, and assigns the gate outputs to `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out`.
4. Connects the gate outputs to the D inputs of the flip-flops using an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
5. Connects the flip-flop outputs to the final XNOR gate, and assigns its output to the `z` signal.

The module should compile and function correctly based on the given problem statement.'}
