The corrected Verilog module implements the finite state machine circuit as described in the problem statement. The key aspects are:

1. Declaring the D flip-flops and their complemented outputs as registers.
2. Implementing the logic for the D flip-flops in the `always` block, where the next state is assigned based on the current state and the input `x`.
3. Implementing the XNOR gate using the `assign` statement, which takes the XOR of the three flip-flop outputs and then complements the result to obtain the final output `z`.

The module is now complete and should compile without any errors.'}
