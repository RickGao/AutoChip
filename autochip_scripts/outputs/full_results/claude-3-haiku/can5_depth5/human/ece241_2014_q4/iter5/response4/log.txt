The issue with the previous module was that the flip-flop outputs were not being updated correctly. In the corrected module, the D inputs of the flip-flops are assigned the correct values based on the XOR, AND, and OR gate outputs, and the flip-flop outputs are then used to compute the final XNOR output.'}
