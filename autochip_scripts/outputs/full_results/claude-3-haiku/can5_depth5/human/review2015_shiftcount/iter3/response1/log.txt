    // If both shift_ena and count_ena are 1, the module will shift in the new data
    // and then decrement the value, which is the expected behavior.
end

endmodule

The key changes are:

1. In the `else if (count_ena)` block, the decrement operation was using `q - 1` which would result in an unsigned underflow. This has been changed to `q - 1'b1` to correctly decrement the 4-bit value.

2. The module now correctly handles the case where both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are 1 at the same time, by first shifting in the new data and then decrementing the value. This was the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

With these changes, the module should now pass the provided testbench.'}
