The issue with the previous module was that the decrement operation was not implemented correctly. Instead of subtracting 1, the module was subtracting the entire 4-bit value 1, which resulted in incorrect behavior. By changing the decrement to `q - 1'b1`, the module now correctly decrements the value in the shift register by 1 when `count_ena` is 1.'}
