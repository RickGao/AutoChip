The main changes are:

1. Used 4-bit BCD representation for `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` instead of 8-bit. This ensures the values are always in the valid BCD range.
2. Initialized `hh` to 12 instead of 8'h12 to match the 4-bit BCD representation.
3. Incremented `hh` using 4-bit addition instead of 8-bit.

This should fix the issues reported in the simulation output.'}
