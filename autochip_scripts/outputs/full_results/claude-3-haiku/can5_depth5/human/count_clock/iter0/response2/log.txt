The provided Verilog code implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The key features are:

1. The clock is incremented on the positive edge of `clk` when `ena` is high.
2. The `reset` signal has the highest priority and resets the clock to "12:00 AM" when asserted.
3. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` variables are 8-bit registers that store the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) respectively, in BCD format.
4. The `pm` register is used to track whether the time is AM or PM.
5. The clock increments the seconds, then minutes, and then hours, with appropriate handling for the 12-hour cycle and AM/PM transition.

This Verilog module should correctly implement the desired 12-hour clock functionality.'}
