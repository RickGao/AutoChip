The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. The module has the following inputs and outputs:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal that resets the clock to "12:00 AM".
   - `ena`: The enable signal that triggers the clock to increment once per second.
   - `pm`: The output signal that indicates if the clock is in PM mode.
   - `hh`, `mm`, `ss`: The output signals representing the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format.

2. The module uses a single `always` block that is sensitive to the `clk` signal.
3. When the `reset` signal is high, the module resets the clock to "12:00 AM" and sets the `pm` signal to 0 (AM).
4. When the `ena` signal is high, the module increments the seconds. If the seconds reach 59, the minutes are incremented. If the minutes reach 59, the hours are incremented, and the `pm` signal is toggled when the hours reach 11.
5. The module handles the 12-hour format by resetting the hours to 1 when they reach 12, and setting the `pm` signal accordingly.

This Verilog module should implement the required 12-hour clock functionality as per the given specification.'}
