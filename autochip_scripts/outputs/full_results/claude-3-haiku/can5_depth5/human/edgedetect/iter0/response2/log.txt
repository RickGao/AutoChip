The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

The module has three ports:
- `clk`: the clock input
- `in`: an 8-bit input vector
- `pedge`: an 8-bit output vector

The module uses a register `in_prev` to store the previous state of the `in` vector. In the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, the current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev`, and the `pedge` output is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` vector and the inverted previous `in_prev` vector. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector and sets the corresponding bit in `pedge`.'}
