{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

The main issues with the previous module were:

1. The `done` signal was not being set correctly. It should be set to 1 in the cycle immediately after the third byte is received.
2. The `out_bytes` register was not being updated correctly. It should be assigned the incoming bytes in the appropriate positions.

In the corrected module, the `done` signal is set to 1 in the `state == 2` case, and the `out_bytes` register is updated with the incoming bytes in the appropriate positions.

Please let me know if this corrected module works as expected.'}
