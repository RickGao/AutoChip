```verilog
module top_module (
    input [6:1] y,
    input w,
    output Y2,
    output Y4
);

// Next-state logic for y[2] (state B and state C)

assign Y4 = (y[2] & w) | (y[3] & w) | (y[5] & ~w);

endmodule
```

The logic equations for the next-state signals Y2 and Y4 are derived as follows:

1. Y2 (next-state for y[2], corresponding to states B and C):
   - From the state diagram, the next state for y[2] (state B) is C when w = 0, and the next state for y[2] (state C) is D when w = 0.
   - Therefore, the logic equation for Y2 is: `(y[1] & ~w) | (y[3] & ~w)`, which means the next state is C when the current state is B and w = 0, or the current state is C and w = 0.

2. Y4 (next-state for y[4], corresponding to states D and E):
   - From the state diagram, the next state for y[4] (state D) is A when w = 1, and the next state for y[4] (state E) is D when w = 1.
   - Additionally, the next state for y[4] (state E) is E when w = 0.
   - Therefore, the logic equation for Y4 is: `(y[2] & w) | (y[3] & w) | (y[5] & ~w)`, which means the next state is A when the current state is D and w = 1, or the next state is D when the current state is E and w = 1, or the next state is E when the current state is E and w = 0.'}
