{'assistant': 'Apologies for the issues with the previous module. Here's the corrected version:

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg d_reg;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
        d_reg <= d;
        q <= d_reg;
    end

endmodule

The key changes are:
1. The `always` block now uses `@(posedge clk or negedge clk)` to capture both the positive and negative edges of the clock.
2. The assignment to `q` is now simply `q <= d_reg;` to capture the value of the input `d` on both clock edges.

This should address the issues reported in the testbench simulation.'}
