{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.

{'assistant': 'Here is the Verilog code for a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg d_reg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        d_reg <= d;
        q <= (clk ^ d_reg);
    end

endmodule
```

The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use a registered version of the input `d` signal, `d_reg`, which is updated on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The output `q` is assigned the XOR of the clock signal `clk` and the registered input `d_reg`.

This effectively creates a flip-flop that is triggered on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, as the XOR operation will toggle the output on both the rising and falling edges of the clock, depending on the value of `d_reg`.

This approach allows us to implement the desired dual-edge triggered flip-flop functionality without using the unsupported `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` construct.'}
