The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D-type flip-flops (d_ff1 and d_ff2) and combinational logic. The key aspects are:

1. The first `always` block updates the two flip-flops on the positive edge of the clock, effectively capturing the input 'D' on both the rising and falling edges of the clock.
2. The second `always` block uses combinational logic to generate the output 'Q' based on the exclusive-OR of the two flip-flop outputs. This implements the desired behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

By using this approach, the module achieves the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on a sensitivity list that includes both the positive and negative edges of the clock, which is not supported in standard FPGA designs.'}
