This Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two D flip-flops. The first flip-flop, `d_ff1`, samples the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock. The second flip-flop, `d_ff2`, samples the output of `d_ff1` on the positive edge of the clock.

The final output `q` is the exclusive-OR of the outputs of `d_ff1` and `d_ff2`. This effectively creates a dual-edge triggered behavior, where `q` changes on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.'}
