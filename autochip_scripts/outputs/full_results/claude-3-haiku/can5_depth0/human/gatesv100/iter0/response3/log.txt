{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].\n\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [99:0] in,\n\toutput [98:0] out_both,\n\toutput [99:1] out_any,\n\toutput [99:0] out_different\n);"}

    output [99:0] out_different

        end

endmodule
```

The module uses a combination of individual assignments and a `genvar` loop to generate the required output vectors. The key points are:

1. `out_both[i]` is assigned the AND of the current bit `in[i]` and the next bit `in[i+1]`.
2. `out_any[99]` is assigned the value of `in[99]` directly, since the first bit has no neighbor to the right.
3. `out_any[j]` is assigned the OR of the previous bit `in[j-1]` and the current bit `in[j]`.
4. `out_different[0]` is assigned the XOR of the first bit `in[0]` and the last bit `in[99]`, to handle the wrap-around case.
5. `out_different[k]` is assigned the XOR of the current bit `in[k]` and the previous bit `in[k-1]`.

The module should correctly implement the given specification.'}
