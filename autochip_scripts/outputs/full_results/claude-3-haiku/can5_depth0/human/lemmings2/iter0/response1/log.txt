{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

The provided Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal that resets the Lemming machine to walk left.
- `bump_left`: Signal indicating that the Lemming has been bumped on the left.
- `bump_right`: Signal indicating that the Lemming has been bumped on the right.
- `ground`: Signal indicating the presence or absence of ground.

Outputs:
- `walk_left`: Indicates that the Lemming is walking left.
- `walk_right`: Indicates that the Lemming is walking right.
- `aaah`: Indicates that the Lemming is falling and saying "aaah!".

The state machine has two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`. The state transitions are as follows:

1. If the Lemming is walking left (`WALK_LEFT` state) and is bumped on the right (`bump_right` is 1), it will transition to the `WALK_RIGHT` state.
2. If the Lemming is walking right (`WALK_RIGHT` state) and is bumped on the left (`bump_left` is 1), it will transition to the `WALK_LEFT` state.
3. If the ground disappears (`ground` is 0), the Lemming will set the `aaah` output to 1, indicating that it is falling and saying "aaah!".
4. If the Lemming is in either the `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT` state and the ground disappears (`ground` is 0), it will stop walking (both `walk_left` and `walk_right` are set to 0).
5. When the ground reappears (`ground` is 1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.

The asynchronous reset signal `areset` is used to reset the state machine to the `WALK_LEFT` state.'}
