{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\tinput dig,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah,\n\toutput digging\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal
- `bump_left`: Indicates a bump on the left side
- `bump_right`: Indicates a bump on the right side
- `ground`: Indicates the presence of ground
- `dig`: Indicates a digging command

Outputs:
- `walk_left`: Indicates the Lemming is walking left
- `walk_right`: Indicates the Lemming is walking right
- `aaah`: Indicates the Lemming is falling
- `digging`: Indicates the Lemming is digging

The state machine has four states:
1. `STATE_WALK_LEFT`: The Lemming is walking left.
2. `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`: The Lemming is walking right.
3. `STATE_FALLING`: The Lemming is falling.
4. `STATE_DIGGING`: The Lemming is digging.

The state transitions are handled in the `always @(*)` block, which updates the output signals and the next state based on the current state and input signals.

The asynchronous reset is handled in the `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block, which sets the initial state to `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and initializes the output signals accordingly.

This Verilog code should correctly model the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
