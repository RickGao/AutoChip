{'role': 'user', 'content': '// For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to positive edge detection).

The corrected module performs the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous value of the input `in`.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`:
   - Assigns the current value of `in` to `in_prev`, effectively storing the previous input value.
   - Assigns the result of `in & ~in_prev` to `pedge`, which sets the output bit high if the corresponding input bit has transitioned from 0 to 1.

This implementation correctly detects the 0 to 1 transitions on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding output bit in the cycle after the transition occurs.'}
