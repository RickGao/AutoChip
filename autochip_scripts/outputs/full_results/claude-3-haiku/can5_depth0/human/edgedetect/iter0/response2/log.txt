The corrected Verilog module first uses a register `in_dly` to store the previous value of the `in` vector. Then, in the `always` block, it assigns the current `in` value to `in_dly` on the positive edge of the clock. It then computes the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` value and the negation of the delayed `in_dly` value (`in & ~in_dly`). The result is stored in the `pedge` output register.'}
