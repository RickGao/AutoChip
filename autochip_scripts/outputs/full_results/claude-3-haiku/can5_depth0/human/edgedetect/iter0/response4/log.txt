The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. Registers the previous input value `in_prev` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. Computes the positive edge detection logic by performing a bitwise AND between the current input `in` and the inverted previous input `~in_prev`. This ensures that the output bit is set when the corresponding input bit transitions from 0 to 1.
3. Assigns the positive edge detection result to the output `pedge` register.

This implementation correctly detects the positive edge transitions for each bit in the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding output bit in the following clock cycle.'}
