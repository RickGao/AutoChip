The completed Verilog module does the following:

1. Declares a 9-bit wire `sum` to hold the result of the addition.
2. Performs the addition of the two 8-bit numbers `a` and `b` by first sign-extending them to 9 bits using the most significant bit `a[7]` and `b[7]`, and then adding the extended values.
3. Assigns the lower 8 bits of `sum` to the output `s`.
4. Detects an overflow condition by checking if the two input operands have the same sign (`a[7] == b[7]`), but the sign of the result (`sum[7]`) is different from the input operands. This indicates that the result has exceeded the range of the 8-bit 2's complement representation.
5. Assigns the overflow condition to the output `overflow`.'}
