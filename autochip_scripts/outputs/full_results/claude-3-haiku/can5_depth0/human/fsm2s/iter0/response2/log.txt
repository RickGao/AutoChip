The provided Verilog module implements the specified Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output. The module has the following features:

1. The state is stored in the `state` register, which can take two values: `OFF` (0) and `ON` (1).
2. The `next_state` is computed in the combinational logic block, which updates the `state` register on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `reset` signal is an active-high synchronous reset that sets the state to `OFF`.
4. The output `out` is assigned the appropriate value based on the current state.
5. The state transitions are implemented according to the given specifications:
   - From `OFF` state, if `j` is 0, stay in `OFF` state, and if `j` is 1, transition to `ON` state.
   - From `ON` state, if `k` is 0, stay in `ON` state, and if `k` is 1, transition to `OFF` state.

The module is complete and should compile and function correctly.'}
