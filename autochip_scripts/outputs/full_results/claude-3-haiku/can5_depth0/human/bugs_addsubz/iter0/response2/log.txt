```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `case` statement was not handling the `do_sub` input correctly. It should be `0` for addition and `1` for subtraction.
2. The check for zero was not correct. The original code used `~out` to check for zero, which is not correct because `out` can have a non-zero value even if the result is zero. The correct way to check for zero is to compare `out` with `8'b0`.

The corrected code resolves these issues and should work as expected.'}
