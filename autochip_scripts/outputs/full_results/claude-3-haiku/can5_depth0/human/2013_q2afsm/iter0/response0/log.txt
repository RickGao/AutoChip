This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The provided Verilog code represents the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` takes the following inputs and outputs:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `resetn`: The active-low synchronous reset signal.
   - `r[3:1]`: The request signals from the three devices.
   - `g[3:1]`: The grant signals to the three devices.

2. The state codes are defined using preprocessor macros: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.

3. The "state table" is implemented in the first `always` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the request signals.

4. The "state flip-flops" are implemented in the second `always` block, which updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock, or resets the state to `STATE_A` when `resetn` is low.

5. The output logic is defined using continuous assignment statements, which set the grant signals `g[3:1]` based on the current state of the FSM.

This Verilog code correctly represents the FSM described in the problem statement and should compile without any issues.'}
