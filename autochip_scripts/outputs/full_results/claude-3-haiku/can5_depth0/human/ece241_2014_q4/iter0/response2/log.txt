The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the following components:

1. Three D flip-flops (dff) to store the current state of the machine.
2. XOR, AND, and OR gates connected to the input `x` and the corresponding flip-flop outputs to generate the next state logic.
3. A three-input XNOR gate to compute the output `z` based on the current state of the three flip-flops.
4. The `dff` module defines the behavior of the D flip-flops, where the output `q` is assigned the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock, and the complementary output `q_n` is assigned the inverse of `d`.

The circuit is designed such that the output `z` is the XNOR of the three flip-flop outputs, which will be high (1) when all three flip-flop outputs are either all high or all low.'}
