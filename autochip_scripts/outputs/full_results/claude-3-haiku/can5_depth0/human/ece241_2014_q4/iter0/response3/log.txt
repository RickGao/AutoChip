The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the following components:

1. A top-level module `top_module` that takes `clk` and `x` as inputs, and produces the output `z`.
2. Three D flip-flops (`d1`, `d2`, and `d3`) that store the state of the circuit.
3. The necessary combinational logic to connect the inputs and outputs of the flip-flops, including the XOR, AND, and OR gates.
4. The final XNOR gate that produces the output `z`.
5. A separate module `dff` that implements the D flip-flop behavior.

The D flip-flops are initialized to zero before the circuit begins operation, as specified in the problem statement.'}
