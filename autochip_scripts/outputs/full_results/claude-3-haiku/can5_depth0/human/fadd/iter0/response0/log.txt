The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be completed as shown above. The key steps are:

1. Declare the necessary internal wires `w1`, `w2`, and `w3` to hold the intermediate results.
2. Assign the value of `a ^ b` to `w1`, which represents the sum of `a` and `b` without the carry.
3. Assign the value of `a & b` to `w2`, which represents the carry from the addition of `a` and `b`.
4. Assign the value of `w1 & cin` to `w3`, which represents the carry from the addition of `w1` (sum of `a` and `b`) and `cin`.
5. Assign the value of `w1 ^ cin` to `sum`, which is the final sum.
6. Assign the value of `w2 | w3` to `cout`, which is the final carry-out.

This completes the full adder module implementation.'}
