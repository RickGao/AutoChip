The key points of the implementation are:

1. Use a 2-state Moore machine (IDLE and COMPUTE) to control the 2's complement computation.
2. Initialize the `sum` register to `8'b11111111` in the IDLE state when the first input bit is received.
3. Shift the 2's complement in the COMPUTE state, taking the complement of the input bit before shifting.
4. Output the MSB of the `sum` register as the 2's complement output `z`.
5. Transition back to the IDLE state when the final input bit (0) is received.
6. Handle the asynchronous reset correctly, resetting the state and output.

This implementation correctly computes the 2's complement of the input bits of arbitrary length.'}
