{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid.

The provided Verilog module implements the "Game of Life" cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The key features of the implementation are:

1. The `get_alive_neighbors` function calculates the number of alive neighbors for a given cell index `i`. It checks the 8 neighboring cells and returns the count of alive cells.

2. The `always` block handles the game state updates. If the `load` signal is high, it loads the initial state from the `data` input. Otherwise, it iterates through all 256 cells and updates their state based on the rules of the Game of Life.

3. The module uses the toroidal grid behavior, where the cells at the edges of the grid wrap around to the other side.

4. The output `q` is a 256-bit vector representing the current state of the 16x16 grid, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a 16-bit sub-vector.

This Verilog module provides a complete implementation of the Game of Life cellular automaton as per the given specification.'}
