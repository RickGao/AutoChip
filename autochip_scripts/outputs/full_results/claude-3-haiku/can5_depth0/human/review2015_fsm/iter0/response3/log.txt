The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine (FSM) that controls the timer functionality as described in the problem statement. The module has the following key features:

1. The FSM has 5 states: `IDLE`, `DETECT_START`, `SHIFT_DURATION`, `WAIT_COUNTER`, and `NOTIFY_TIMER`.
2. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the start sequence of `1101` to be detected on the `data` input.
3. When the start sequence is detected, the module transitions to the `SHIFT_DURATION` state, where it asserts the `shift_ena` output for exactly 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration value.
4. After the duration is shifted in, the module transitions to the `WAIT_COUNTER` state, where it asserts the `counting` output and waits for the `done_counting` input to be high, indicating that the counters have finished counting.
5. Once the counters have finished, the module transitions to the `NOTIFY_TIMER` state, where it asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out. It then waits for the `ack` input to be high before resetting to the `IDLE` state.
6. The module also has a synchronous reset, which sets the state to `IDLE` and clears the output signals.

This implementation should correctly control the timer functionality as described in the problem statement.'}
