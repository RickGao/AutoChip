This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine for the timer as per the given specification. The module has the following states:

1. `WAIT_START`: This state waits for the input data sequence "1101" to be received. Once the sequence is detected, it transitions to the `SHIFT_DURATION` state.

2. `SHIFT_DURATION`: This state asserts the `shift_ena` output for 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration value.

3. `WAIT_COUNTING`: This state asserts the `counting` output and waits for the `done_counting` input to be high, indicating that the counters have finished counting.

4. `NOTIFY_COMPLETE`: This state asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out.

5. `WAIT_ACK`: This state waits for the `ack` input to be high, indicating that the user has acknowledged the timer completion. Once the `ack` is received, the state machine resets to the `WAIT_START` state.

The module also has a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to `WAIT_START`.'}
