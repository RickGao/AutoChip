When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The main changes made are:

1. Added a `localparam` for the state definitions, making the code more readable.
2. Separated the state update and output logic into separate `always` blocks for clarity.
3. Handled the reset condition properly, setting all outputs to their initial values.
4. Corrected the state transition logic to match the given specification.
5. Ensured that the `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` outputs are set correctly in each state.

This implementation should now correctly implement the timer state machine as described in the problem statement.'}
