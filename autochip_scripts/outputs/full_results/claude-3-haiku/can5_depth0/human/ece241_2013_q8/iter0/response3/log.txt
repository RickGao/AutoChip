The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has three states: `IDLE`, `FOUND_1`, and `FOUND_10`.

The state machine operates as follows:

1. In the `IDLE` state, if the input `x` is 1, the next state becomes `FOUND_1`. Otherwise, the state remains in `IDLE`.
2. In the `FOUND_1` state, if the input `x` is 0, the next state becomes `FOUND_10`. If `x` is 1, the state remains in `FOUND_1`.
3. In the `FOUND_10` state, if the input `x` is 1, the next state becomes `FOUND_1`. If `x` is 0, the state transitions back to `IDLE`.

The output signal `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the state machine reaches the `FOUND_10` state, indicating that the "101" sequence has been detected. The FSM also has a negative edge-triggered asynchronous reset, controlled by the `aresetn` signal.

The code includes the necessary state updates, next state logic, and output logic to implement the desired Mealy-type finite state machine.'}
