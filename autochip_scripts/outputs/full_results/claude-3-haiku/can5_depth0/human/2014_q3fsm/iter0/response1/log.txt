The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. `STATE_A`: The reset state where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, the FSM transitions to `STATE_B`.
2. `STATE_B`: The state where the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.
3. `STATE_C`: The state where the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 if `w = 1` in exactly two of the three clock cycles in `STATE_B`, otherwise `z` is set to 0.

The module uses a `count` variable to keep track of the number of clock cycles in `STATE_B`, and the `next_state` logic to determine the next state based on the current state and the input values.'}
