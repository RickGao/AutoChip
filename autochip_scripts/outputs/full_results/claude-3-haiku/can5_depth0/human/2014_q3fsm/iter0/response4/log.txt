The key points of this implementation are:

1. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C.
2. In state A, the FSM remains in A if `s` is 0, and transitions to B if `s` is 1.
3. In state B, the FSM transitions to C if `w` is 1, otherwise it remains in B.
4. In state C, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 if `w` was 1 in exactly two of the last three clock cycles, otherwise `z` is set to 0. The FSM then transitions back to state B.
5. The reset is handled synchronously, setting the state to A and the output `z` to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to fulfill the given specification.'}
