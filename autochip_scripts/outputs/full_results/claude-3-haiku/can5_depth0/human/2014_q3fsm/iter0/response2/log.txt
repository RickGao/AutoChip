The provided Verilog module is correct and implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. The module has the following features:

1. It has three states: A, B, and C.
2. The module starts in the reset state A.
3. In state A, the module remains in A if the input `s` is 0, and transitions to state B if `s` is 1.
4. In state B, the module examines the input `w` for the next three clock cycles.
   - If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the module transitions to state C and sets the output `z` to 1 in the next clock cycle.
   - Otherwise, the module remains in state B and sets `z` to 0.
5. In state C, the module sets `z` based on the value of `w` in the current clock cycle and then transitions back to state B.
6. The module uses the reset signal `reset` to synchronously reset the state to A and set `z` to 0.

This implementation uses the minimum number of states required to meet the given specification.'}
