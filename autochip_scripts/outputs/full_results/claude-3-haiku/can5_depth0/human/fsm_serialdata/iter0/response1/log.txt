{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received from a stream of bits. The module has the following functionality:

1. The module has four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.
2. In the IDLE state, the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. Once the start bit is detected, the module transitions to the START state.
4. In the START state, the module checks if the start bit is still 0. If so, it transitions to the DATA state. Otherwise, it goes back to the IDLE state.
5. In the DATA state, the module reads the 8 data bits and stores them in the `data_reg` register.
6. Once all 8 data bits have been read, the module transitions to the STOP state.
7. In the STOP state, the module checks if the stop bit is 1. If so, it assigns the `data_reg` value to the `out_byte` output and asserts the `done` output. Then, it goes back to the IDLE state.
8. If the stop bit is not 1, the module goes back to the IDLE state and waits for the next start bit.
9. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality that resets the state machine and output registers when `reset` is asserted.
10. The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, as required by the specification.

This Verilog module should correctly identify and receive bytes from the given stream of bits.'}
