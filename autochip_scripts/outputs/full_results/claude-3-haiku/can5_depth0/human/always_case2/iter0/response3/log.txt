For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder.

The provided Verilog module is a 4-bit priority encoder that outputs the position of the first '1' bit in the input vector. The module uses a `casex` statement to check the input bits and assign the corresponding output value to the `pos` register.

The `casex` statement is used because it allows for wildcard matching, where 'x' represents a don't-care condition. This allows the module to efficiently handle the different cases without needing to explicitly check each individual bit.

The default case is added to ensure that if none of the input bits are high (i.e., the input is zero), the output is set to 2'd0.'}
