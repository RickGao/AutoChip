This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops. The key aspects are:

1. We use two separate `always` blocks, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge of the clock.
2. In each `always` block, we update both `q` and an additional register `q_neg` with the new data.
3. In a third `always` block triggered on any change, we compare the current value of `q` with `q_neg`. If they differ, it means a clock edge has occurred, so we simply hold the current value of `q`. Otherwise, we update `q` with the new data.

This approach allows us to capture the data on both clock edges and present the correct output without relying on a non-standard "dual-edge triggered" flip-flop.'}
