The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate `always` blocks, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. 

The first `always` block updates the `q` register on the positive clock edge with the value of the `d` input, and also stores the inverted value of `d` in the `q_neg` register.

The second `always` block, triggered on the negative clock edge, updates the `q` register with the value stored in `q_neg`, effectively creating the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This approach allows the module to function as a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, despite the FPGA limitation of not supporting the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
