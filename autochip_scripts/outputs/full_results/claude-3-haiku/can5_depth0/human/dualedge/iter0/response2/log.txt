The key aspects of this implementation are:

1. We use two separate edge-triggered flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`q_pos`) and one triggered on the negative edge of the clock (`q_neg`).
2. The `always` block for the positive edge flip-flop updates `q_pos` on the positive clock edge.
3. The `always` block for the negative edge flip-flop updates `q_neg` on the negative clock edge.
4. The final output `q` is determined by a combinational `always` block that looks at the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` and selects the appropriate value based on the dual-edge behavior.

This implementation faithfully recreates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available FPGA primitives.'}
