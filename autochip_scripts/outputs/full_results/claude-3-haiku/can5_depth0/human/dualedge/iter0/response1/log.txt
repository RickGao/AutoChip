In this implementation, we use two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. The final output `q` is then selected based on the current value of the clock signal. When the clock is high, `q` takes the value of `q_pos`, and when the clock is low, `q` takes the value of `q_neg`. This effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
