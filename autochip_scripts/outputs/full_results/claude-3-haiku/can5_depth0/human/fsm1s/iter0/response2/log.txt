The provided Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine with two states, one input, and one output. The reset state is `B`, and the reset is active-high synchronous.

The module uses a `state` register to keep track of the current state (`STATE_A` or `STATE_B`). The `out` output is set based on the current state, with `out` being `1` in state `B` and `0` in state `A`.

The state transition logic is implemented in the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. If the `reset` input is high, the state is set to `STATE_B` and the `out` output is set to `1`. Otherwise, the state transitions are handled based on the current state and the `in` input, as per the given state machine diagram.'}
