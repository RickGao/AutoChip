The provided Verilog code implements the next-state logic for the given state machine using one-hot encoding.

The logic for `Y2` (corresponding to the next state of signal `y[2]`, which represents states B and C) is derived as follows:
- State B transitions to state C on `w = 0`, so the term `(y[1] & ~w)` is included.
- State C transitions to state D on `w = 1`, so the term `(y[3] & w)` is included.

The logic for `Y4` (corresponding to the next state of signal `y[4]`, which represents states C, D, E, and F) is derived as follows:
- State C transitions to state E on `w = 0`, so the term `(y[3] & ~w)` is included.
- State C transitions to state D on `w = 1`, so the term `(y[3] & w)` is included.
- State D transitions to state F on `w = 0`, so the term `(y[4] & ~w)` is included.
- State D transitions to state A on `w = 1`, so the term `(y[4] & w)` is included.
- State E remains in state E on `w = 0`, so the term `(y[5] & ~w)` is included.
- State E transitions to state D on `w = 1`, so the term `(y[5] & w)` is included.
- State F transitions to state C on `w = 0`, so the term `(y[6] & ~w)` is included.
- State F transitions to state D on `w = 1`, so the term `(y[6] & w)` is included.'}
