{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module provided above implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. It includes the following features:

1. The FSM has four states: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, and `STOP`.
2. The `IDLE` state waits for the detection of a start bit (0).
3. The `START` state receives the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
4. The `DATA` state checks for the expected stop bit (1). If the stop bit is present, it transitions to the `STOP` state. If the stop bit is not present, it returns to the `IDLE` state to wait for the next start bit.
5. The `STOP` state waits for the complete stop bit and then sets the `done` output high to indicate that a byte has been received correctly.
6. The module includes a synchronous reset that sets the state to `IDLE` and resets the internal counters and registers.
7. The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first, and the module handles this accordingly.

The provided Verilog module should correctly identify the reception of bytes in the given serial communication protocol.'}
