{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has four states:

1. `STATE_WAIT_START`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `STATE_READ_DATA`: Reads the 8 data bits, storing them in the `data_reg` register.
3. `STATE_READ_STOP`: Checks the stop bit (1) and sets the `done` output high if it is correct.
4. `STATE_ERROR`: Waits for the next start bit if the stop bit was incorrect.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset signal (`reset`) to initialize the state, bit count, and data register. The `in` signal is the serial data input, and the `done` output signal is set high when a byte has been correctly received.

The FSM handles the least significant bit first, as specified in the serial protocol. If the stop bit is not correct, the FSM waits for the next start bit before attempting to receive the next byte.'}
