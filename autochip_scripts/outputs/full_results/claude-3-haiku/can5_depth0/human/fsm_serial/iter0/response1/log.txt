{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The module has the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Waits for the detection of a start bit.
2. **START**: Verifies the start bit is detected.
3. **DATA**: Shifts in the 8 data bits, one bit per clock cycle.
4. **STOP**: Verifies the stop bit is detected.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset functionality and sets the `done` output high when a byte has been correctly received.

The module handles the least significant bit being sent first, as required by the serial communication protocol.'}
