{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The corrected Verilog module above implements the finite state machine to identify correctly received bytes in the given serial communication protocol.

Key features:
1. The module has three states: IDLE, START, and STOP.
2. In the IDLE state, the module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. In the START state, the module reads the 8 data bits, and then checks for the stop bit (1).
   - If the stop bit is detected, the module transitions to the STOP state.
   - If the stop bit is missing, the module returns to the IDLE state.
4. In the STOP state, the module verifies the stop bit is valid (1).
   - If the stop bit is valid, the module sets the `done` output high and returns to the IDLE state.
   - If the stop bit is invalid, the module returns to the IDLE state.
5. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality based on the `reset` input.'}
