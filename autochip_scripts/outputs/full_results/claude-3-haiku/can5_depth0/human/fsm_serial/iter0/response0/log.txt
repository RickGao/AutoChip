{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The state machine has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit (0) to begin receiving a new byte.
2. `START`: Detecting the start bit and preparing to receive the 8 data bits.
3. `DATA`: Receiving the 8 data bits, least significant bit first.
4. `STOP`: Verifying the presence of the stop bit (1).
5. `ERROR`: Handling the case where the stop bit is not detected as expected.

The module has the following inputs and outputs:
- `clk`: The system clock.
- `in`: The input bit stream from the serial communication.
- `reset`: A synchronous reset signal.
- `done`: An active-high output signal indicating that a byte has been successfully received.

The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the current position in the byte, and a `data_reg` variable to store the received data byte. The state machine transitions between the states based on the current state, the input bit, and the `bit_count` value.

If the stop bit is not detected as expected, the state machine enters the `ERROR` state and waits until it detects a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.'}
