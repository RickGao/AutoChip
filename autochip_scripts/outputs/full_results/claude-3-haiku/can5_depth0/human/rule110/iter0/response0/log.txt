{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The Verilog code above implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's how it works:

1. The `top_module` takes `clk`, `load`, and `data[511:0]` as inputs, and produces `q[511:0]` as the output.
2. When `load` is high, the current state of the system (`data[511:0]`) is loaded into `q[511:0]`.
3. When `load` is low, the state of the system is updated according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on the left boundary (`q[-1]`), the current value of `q[0]`, and the right neighbor `q[1]`.
   - The middle cells `q[1]` to `q[510]` are updated based on their left neighbor, current value, and right neighbor.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is updated based on the left neighbor `q[510]`, the current value of `q[511]`, and the right boundary (which is set to 0).

This implementation assumes that the left and right boundaries (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are both 0 (off), as specified in the problem statement.'}
