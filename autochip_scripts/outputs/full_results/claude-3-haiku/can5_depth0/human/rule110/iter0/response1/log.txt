{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

            q <= next_q;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The key points in the implementation are:

1. Declare a temporary variable `next_q` to store the next state of each cell.
2. On the `load` signal, directly assign the input `data` to the output `q`.
3. On the clock edge, compute the next state of each cell based on the Rule 110 logic:
   - For the first cell (index 0), use the boundary condition that the left neighbor is 0.
   - For the last cell (index 511), use the boundary condition that the right neighbor is 0.
   - For all other cells, use the states of the current cell and its two neighbors.
4. Update the output `q` with the new state stored in `next_q`.

This implementation ensures that the 512-cell system is updated correctly according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton.'}
