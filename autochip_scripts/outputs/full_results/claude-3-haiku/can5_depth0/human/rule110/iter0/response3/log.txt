{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton as described. The module has three inputs:

1. `clk`: The clock input.
2. `load`: An active high load input that loads the initial state of the cellular automaton from the `data` input.
3. `data`: A 512-bit input that represents the initial state of the cellular automaton.

The module has one output:

1. `q`: A 512-bit output that represents the current state of the cellular automaton.

The module uses an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. If the `load` input is high, the current state `q` is updated to the value of the `data` input. Otherwise, the current state is updated according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The first and last cells in the array are updated using the assumption that the boundary conditions are both zero (off).'}
