{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described. The module has two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`, which are represented by the `state` register. The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are updated based on the current state.

The module operates as follows:

1. When the `areset` signal is high, the module is reset to the `WALK_LEFT` state, and the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set accordingly.
2. On each clock cycle, the module checks the current state and the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs:
   - If the current state is `WALK_LEFT` and the `bump_right` input is high, the state is updated to `WALK_RIGHT`.
   - If the current state is `WALK_RIGHT` and the `bump_left` input is high, the state is updated to `WALK_LEFT`.
3. The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are updated based on the current state.

The module correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement.'}
