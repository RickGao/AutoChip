The provided Verilog module specification defines a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The module has the following inputs and output:

- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `w`: The input to the first stage of the shift register.
- `R`: The value to be loaded into the register.
- `E`: The enable signal for shifting.
- `L`: The load signal, when asserted the register should load the value from `R`.
- `Q`: The output of the flip-flop in the current stage.

The implementation of the `top_module` uses a single `always` block that handles the logic for both loading the value from `R` and shifting the value from the previous stage (`w`). The module uses a conditional assignment to update the output `Q` based on the values of `L` and `E`.

- If `L` is high, the module loads the value from `R` into the flip-flop.
- If `E` is high, the module shifts the value from `w` into the flip-flop.

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified n-bit shift register stage.'}
