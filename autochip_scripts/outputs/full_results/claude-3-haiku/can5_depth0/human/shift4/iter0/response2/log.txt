The completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` takes the following inputs:
   - `clk`: Clock signal
   - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal (active high)
   - `load`: Load signal (active high)
   - `ena`: Enable signal (active high)
   - `data`: 4-bit data input

2. The module has a single output `q`, which is a 4-bit register to hold the contents of the shift register.

3. The module uses an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.

4. Inside the `always` block:
   - If `areset` is high, the shift register `q` is reset to `4'b0000`.
   - If `load` is high, the shift register `q` is loaded with the `data` input.
   - If `ena` is high, the shift register `q` is right-shifted by one bit, with the most significant bit becoming `1'b0`.

5. The behavior of the module matches the given specification:
   - The shift register is reset to zero when `areset` is high.
   - The shift register is loaded with `data[3:0]` when `load` is high.
   - The shift register is shifted right by one bit when `ena` is high, with the most significant bit becoming `1'b0`.
   - If both `load` and `ena` are high, the `load` input has higher priority.'}
