The provided Verilog module specification describes a Moore state machine with four states (A, B, C, D) and one input (in) and one output (out). The state transition table and output logic are also provided.

The implemented Verilog module includes the following components:

1. State and next state variables: The state is stored in the `state` register, and the next state is computed in the `next_state` combinational logic.

2. State transition logic: The `next_state` is assigned based on the current state and the input `in` value, according to the provided state transition table.

3. Output logic: The output `out` is assigned based on the current state, following the provided output logic.

4. State register update: The `state` register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, resetting to state `A` when the `reset` input is active.

The module correctly implements the specified Moore state machine with the given state transition table and output logic, and includes the synchronous active-high reset functionality.'}
