The corrected Verilog module provides the following functionality:

1. The module has a parameter `CYCLES` set to 4, which represents the number of clock cycles the `shift_ena` signal should be asserted.
2. The module uses a 2-bit state variable to keep track of the current state of the FSM: `IDLE`, `ACTIVE`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `always` block, the module checks the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, the module enters the `ACTIVE` state and asserts `shift_ena` to 1.
4. If `reset` is low, the module checks the current state and performs the following actions:
   - In the `ACTIVE` state, the module checks if `shift_ena` is 1 and the `CYCLES` counter has reached 4. If so, it transitions to the `DONE` state and deasserts `shift_ena`.
   - In the `DONE` state, the module keeps `shift_ena` deasserted.
   - In the default case (likely `IDLE`), the module resets the state to `IDLE` and deasserts `shift_ena`.

This corrected module should now provide the desired functionality of enabling the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and resetting the `shift_ena` signal after 4 cycles until the next reset.'}
