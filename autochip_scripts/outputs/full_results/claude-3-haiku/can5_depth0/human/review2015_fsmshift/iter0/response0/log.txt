The module has been corrected to meet the specification. The key changes are:

1. Added a state machine with three states - IDLE, SHIFT, and DONE.
2. The shift_ena signal is set to 1'b1 when the state is SHIFT, and 0 otherwise.
3. The counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the SHIFT state, and is reset to 0 when the state is not SHIFT.
4. The state transitions are handled in the combinational always block, where the next state is determined based on the current state and the counter value.
5. The reset signal is handled synchronously, where the state is set to IDLE and the shift_ena signal is set to 1'b1 for the first 4 clock cycles.'}
