The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Defined the necessary states for the FSM: `IDLE`, `ENABLE`, and `CNT`.
2. Introduced a `count` register to keep track of the number of clock cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the `shift_ena` output is set to `0`. When a reset is detected, the state transitions to `ENABLE` and the `count` is initialized to `3`.
4. In the `ENABLE` state, the `shift_ena` output is set to `1`, and the `count` is decremented on each clock cycle. When the `count` reaches `0`, the state transitions back to `IDLE`.
5. In the default case, the state is set to `IDLE`, the `count` is set to `0`, and `shift_ena` is set to `0`.

This implementation ensures that whenever the reset is asserted, the `shift_ena` output is asserted for 4 clock cycles, and then remains `0` until the next reset.'}
