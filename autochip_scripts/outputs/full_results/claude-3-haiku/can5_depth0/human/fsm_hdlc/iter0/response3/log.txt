{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s.

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences as described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Discard a bit (signal `disc` is asserted).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (signal `flag` is asserted).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more consecutive 1s) (signal `err` is asserted).

The module has the following states:

- `IDLE`: The initial state, where the FSM waits for the first '1' to be detected.
- `WAIT_1`: The state where the FSM waits for the next '1' after the first '1' has been detected.
- `WAIT_5`: The state where the FSM counts the number of consecutive '1's, and discard a bit if the count reaches 5.
- `FLAG`: The state where the FSM detects the flag sequence `01111110` and asserts the `flag` signal.
- `ERROR`: The state where the FSM detects an error sequence (7 or more consecutive '1's) and asserts the `err` signal.

The reset signal is handled by setting the state to `IDLE` on a high reset signal. The output signals (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) are asserted for one complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the corresponding condition occurs.'}
