Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

The provided Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

The finite state machine has the following states:

- `STATE_IDLE`: The initial state, where the input is 0.
- `STATE_ONE` to `STATE_FIVE`: Recognizing the sequence of 5 consecutive 1s.
- `STATE_SIX`: Recognizing the 6th 1 in the sequence, which indicates a flag.
- `STATE_SEVEN`: Recognizing 7 or more consecutive 1s, which indicates an error.

The `next_state` logic and output signal generation are implemented in the `always @(*)` block. The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the state register based on the reset signal and the next state computed in the combinational logic.

The module should correctly recognize the three sequences and assert the corresponding output signals (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.'}
