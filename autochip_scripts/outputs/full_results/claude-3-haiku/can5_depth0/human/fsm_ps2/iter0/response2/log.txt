{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) that detects the boundaries of 3-byte messages in a continuous byte stream. The algorithm follows the description given in the problem statement:

1. The FSM starts in the `STATE_WAIT` state, discarding bytes until it sees one with `in[3]=1`, which indicates the start of a new message.
2. Upon seeing the first byte with `in[3]=1`, the FSM transitions to the `STATE_BYTE1` state.
3. The FSM then transitions to the `STATE_BYTE2` and `STATE_BYTE3` states, receiving the remaining two bytes of the message.
4. After receiving the third byte, the FSM sets the `done` output to `1'b1` in the current cycle, indicating that a complete 3-byte message has been detected.
5. The FSM then transitions back to the `STATE_WAIT` state, ready to detect the next message.
6. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the FSM to the `STATE_WAIT` state and setting the `done` output to `1'b0`.

This implementation should correctly detect and signal the receipt of 3-byte messages in the given input byte stream.'}
