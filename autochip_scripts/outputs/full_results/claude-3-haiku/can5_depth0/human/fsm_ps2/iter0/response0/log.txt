{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The main changes are:

1. Added a `done` output register to signal when a complete 3-byte message has been received.
2. Defined the state parameters for the three states of the FSM: `WAIT_FOR_BYTE1`, `WAIT_FOR_BYTE2`, and `WAIT_FOR_BYTE3`.
3. In the `always` block, the state transition logic is implemented based on the current state and the value of `in[3]`.
   - In the `WAIT_FOR_BYTE1` state, if `in[3]` is 1, the state transitions to `WAIT_FOR_BYTE2`.
   - In the `WAIT_FOR_BYTE2` state, the state transitions to `WAIT_FOR_BYTE3`.
   - In the `WAIT_FOR_BYTE3` state, the state transitions back to `WAIT_FOR_BYTE1`, and the `done` output is set to 1.
4. The `reset` signal is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `WAIT_FOR_BYTE1` and clearing the `done` output.'}
