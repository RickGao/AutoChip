The provided Verilog module code correctly implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. The module has the following features:

1. The finite-state machine has five states: S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4.
2. The current state is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the module is reset synchronously when the `reset` signal is high.
3. In the initial state (S0), the machine looks for a '1' in the input. If a '1' is found, it transitions to state S1.
4. In state S1, the machine looks for another '1' in the input. If a '1' is found, it transitions to state S2, otherwise, it returns to state S0.
5. In state S2, the machine looks for a '0' in the input. If a '0' is found, it transitions to state S3, otherwise, it returns to state S0.
6. In state S3, the machine looks for a '1' in the input. If a '1' is found, it transitions to state S4, otherwise, it returns to state S0.
7. In state S4, the machine sets the `start_shifting` output to '1' and remains in this state until the `reset` signal is asserted.

This Verilog module correctly implements the given finite-state machine specification.'}
