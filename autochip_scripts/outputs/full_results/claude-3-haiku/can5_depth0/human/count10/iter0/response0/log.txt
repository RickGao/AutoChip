The completed Verilog module for the decade counter specification is as follows:

1. The module takes two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the synchronous reset signal).
2. The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current count value.
3. Inside the always block, the counter is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is reset to 0.
5. If the current count `q` is equal to 9, the counter is reset to 0.
6. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and the reset input resets the counter to 0 synchronously.'}
