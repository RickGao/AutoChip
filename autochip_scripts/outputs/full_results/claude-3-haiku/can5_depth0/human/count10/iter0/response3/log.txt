The provided Verilog module is correct and should implement the desired functionality of a decade counter. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module takes two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the active-high synchronous reset signal).
2. The module has one output: `q`, a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. Inside the `always` block, the code checks if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, the counter is reset to `4'b0` (binary 0).
5. If the `reset` signal is not high, the counter value is incremented by 1. The condition `(q == 4'd9)` checks if the current value of `q` is equal to 9. If it is, the counter is reset to `4'b0`, otherwise, it is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and the counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
