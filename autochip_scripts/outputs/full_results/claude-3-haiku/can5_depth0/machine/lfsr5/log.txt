system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top module has 3 inputs and 1 output, where the inputs are clk, reset, and output is q.
The module has 2 always blocks to define the state transition of q and the logic description.
The state transitions are defined in the first always block, which is triggered when q changes.
In the first always block, q_next is assigned with q[4:1], which is the value of q except the LSB bit.
Then, q_next[4] is assigned with q[0], which is the LSB bit.
Lastly, q_next[2] is xored with q[0].
The second always block is triggered at positive edge of clk.
If reset is active, q is assigned with 5'h1, which is the reset value.
If reset is inactive, q is assigned with q_next, which is the state transition.
The port connections of instantiated modules are shown above.
The module takes clk, reset, and q as input.
q is a 5 bit output, which is assigned with 5'h1 at reset and q_next at positive edge of clk.
