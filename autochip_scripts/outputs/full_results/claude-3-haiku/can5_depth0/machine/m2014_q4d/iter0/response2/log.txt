This Verilog module implements the specified toggle flip-flop behavior. The `prev_out` logic signal is used to store the previous value of the output signal `out`. On each positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, the output `out` is set to the XOR of the input `in` and the previous output `prev_out`, effectively toggling the output. The previous output `prev_out` is then updated to the current output `out` to be used in the next clock cycle.'}
