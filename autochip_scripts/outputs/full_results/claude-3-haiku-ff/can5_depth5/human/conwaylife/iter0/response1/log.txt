{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state.

The provided Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module has the following features:

1. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the game grid into the `q` register.
2. The `q` register holds the current state of the 16x16 game grid, which is updated every clock cycle.
3. The `get_neighbors` function calculates the number of live neighbors for a given cell in the grid, considering the toroidal wraparound.
4. The `always @(*)` block computes the next state of the game grid based on the current state and the rules of the Game of Life.

The module correctly implements the Game of Life algorithm and should compile without any errors.'}
