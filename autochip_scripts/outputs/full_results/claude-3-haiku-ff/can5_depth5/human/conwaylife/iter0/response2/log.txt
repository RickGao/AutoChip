{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state. Active high synchronous.\n// (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.\n// The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [255:0] data,\n\toutput reg [255:0] q);'}

The key aspects of the completed Verilog module are:

1. The module has an input `clk` to represent the clock, an input `load` to load the initial state, an input `data` to provide the initial state, and an output `q` to represent the current state of the 16x16 grid.

2. The module uses a `next_state` register to hold the updated state of the grid, and updates `q` based on the current state and the `load` signal.

3. The main logic is implemented in the `always @*` block, which iterates through all 256 cells of the grid and computes the next state of each cell based on the rules of the Game of Life.

4. For each cell, the number of neighbors is counted by checking the 8 adjacent cells, taking into account the toroidal nature of the grid.

5. The next state of the cell is updated based on the number of neighbors, following the rules of the Game of Life.

This Verilog module correctly implements the Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid, and will update the state of the grid at every clock cycle.'}
