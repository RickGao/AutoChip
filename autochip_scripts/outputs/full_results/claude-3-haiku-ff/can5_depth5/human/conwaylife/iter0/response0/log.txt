{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

This Verilog module implements the Conway's Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `load` input allows the initial state of the grid to be loaded, and the `q` output provides the current state of the grid, which is updated every clock cycle.

The module has two main parts:

1. The first `always` block handles the loading of the initial state and the updating of the current state (`q`) based on the next state (`next_q`).
2. The second `always` block computes the next state of the grid based on the current state and the rules of the Game of Life. It iterates over each cell in the grid, computes the number of neighbors for the cell, and updates the next state accordingly.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

- The use of modulo operations (`% 16`) to handle the toroidal wrapping of the grid.
- The computation of the number of neighbors for each cell using nested loops.
- The application of the Game of Life rules to update the next state of each cell.

This implementation should correctly implement the Game of Life on the 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
