{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

This Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The `get_neighbor_count` function calculates the number of living neighbors for a given cell, handling the toroidal nature of the grid. The `always` block updates the game state on each clock cycle, applying the rules of the Game of Life to each cell.

The module has the following ports:
- `clk`: The clock input.
- `load`: A signal that loads the initial state of the game from the `data` input.
- `data`: The 256-bit input that represents the initial state of the 16x16 grid.
- `q`: The 256-bit output that represents the current state of the 16x16 grid.'}
