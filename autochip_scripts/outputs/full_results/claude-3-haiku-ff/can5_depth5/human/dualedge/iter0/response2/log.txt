{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module that implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate posedge and negedge sensitive blocks:

```verilog
module top_module(

);

reg q_posedge, q_negedge;

always @(posedge clk) begin

endmodule
```

This implementation uses two separate always blocks, one sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the other sensitive to the negative edge of the clock. The values of `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` are updated in the respective always blocks. 

The final value of `q` is then determined in a third always block that is sensitive to both the positive and negative edges of the clock. This block uses a case statement to determine the final value of `q` based on the values of `q_posedge` and `q_negedge`.

This implementation ensures that the behavior of the flip-flop is equivalent to a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not directly support such a construct.'}
