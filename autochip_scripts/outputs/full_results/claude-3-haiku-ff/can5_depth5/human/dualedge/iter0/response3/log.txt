The provided code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The final output `q` is selected based on the current state of the clock signal.

This approach allows the circuit to behave like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not natively support such a construct in the Verilog sensitivity list.'}
