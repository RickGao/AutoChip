The key steps to implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard single-edge triggered flip-flops are:

1. Use two separate flip-flops to capture the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`.
2. The first `always` block captures the input `d` on the positive edge of `clk` into the register `q_pos`.
3. The second `always` block captures the input `d` on the negative edge of `clk` into the register `q_neg`.
4. The third `always` block combines the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` into the output `q`, effectively creating the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This implementation ensures that the output `q` follows the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock `clk`, as required for a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
