{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed.

The provided Verilog module is correctly implemented. It uses a register `counter` to keep track of the countdown timer. The `always` block handles the timer logic:

1. If `load` is high, the `counter` is loaded with the `data` value, and the `tc` output is set to 0.
2. If `load` is low and the `counter` is not zero, the `counter` is decremented by 1, and the `tc` output is set to 1 when the `counter` reaches 1, indicating the terminal count.
3. If the `counter` reaches 0, the `tc` output is kept high until the next `load` event.

This implementation correctly implements the desired timer functionality as described in the problem statement.'}
