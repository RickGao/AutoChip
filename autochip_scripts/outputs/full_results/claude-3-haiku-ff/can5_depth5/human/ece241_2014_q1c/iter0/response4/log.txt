endmodule
```

The key points in the corrected module are:

1. The addition is performed on 9-bit wide operands by adding an extra leading 0 to the inputs. This allows the module to handle the full range of 8-bit 2's complement numbers without losing precision.
2. The 8-bit sum is assigned to the output `s`.
3. The overflow condition is checked by comparing the signs of the operands and the result. If the operands have the same sign but the result has a different sign, then an overflow has occurred.'}
