{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. Here's how it works:

1. The `top_module` takes three inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `load` (synchronous active high load input), and `data` (an array of 512 bits representing the initial state of the cells).
2. The `q` register is a 512-bit wide output that represents the current state of the cells.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the `load` signal:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the provided `data` input.
   - If `load` is low, the module advances the state of the cells by one time step according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton logic.
4. The Rule 110 logic is implemented using a `for` loop that iterates through the cells (from index 1 to 510) and updates the state of each cell based on the state of its left and right neighbors.
5. The boundary conditions (for cells at indices 0 and 511) are handled separately, assuming that the boundary cells (q[-1] and q[512]) are both 0 (off).

This Verilog code should correctly implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton with the given specifications.'}
