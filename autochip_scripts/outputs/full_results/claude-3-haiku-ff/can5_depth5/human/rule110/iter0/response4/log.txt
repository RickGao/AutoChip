{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The Verilog code above implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell array. The `q` register stores the current state of the cells, and the `always` block updates the state of the cells on each clock cycle.

The code handles the boundary conditions by setting `q[511]` to 0 (off) since the boundary condition is assumed to be 0. The update of the internal cells follows the Rule 110 logic as per the provided truth table.

The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the cells from the `data` input. When `load` is asserted, the `q` register is updated with the value of `data`.'}
