The completed Verilog module for the decade counter is as follows:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q`. `clk` is the clock input, `reset` is the synchronous reset input (active high), and `q` is the 4-bit output that represents the counter value.

2. The counter's logic is implemented inside the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

3. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 1 (`q <= 1`).

4. If the `reset` input is low, the counter logic is executed. If the current value of `q` is 10, the counter is reset to 1 (`q <= 1`). Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1`).

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 1 to 10, inclusive, and resets to 1 when the `reset` input is active.'}
