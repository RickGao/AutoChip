This Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The clock is clocked by a fast-running `clk` signal, and the `ena` signal indicates when the clock should increment (once per second). The `reset` signal resets the clock to 12:00 AM.

The module uses three 8-bit registers (`hh`, `mm`, and `ss`) to store the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59), respectively. The `pm` output signal is used to indicate whether the clock is in AM or PM mode.

The main logic of the module is implemented in the `always` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The block first checks if the `reset` signal is high, and if so, resets the clock to 12:00 AM. Otherwise, it checks if the `ena` signal is high, and if so, increments the seconds, minutes, and hours as necessary, wrapping around when the maximum values are reached. The `pm` signal is updated accordingly.'}
