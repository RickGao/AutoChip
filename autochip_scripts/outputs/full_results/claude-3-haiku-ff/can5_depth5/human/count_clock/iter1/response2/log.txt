The issues with the previous module were:
1. The hours were not wrapping around correctly from 12 to 1 AM/PM.
2. The BCD representation for the outputs was not correct.

The corrected module addresses these issues by:
1. Checking for the special case of 12 hours and wrapping around to 1 while toggling the PM/AM flag.
2. Ensuring that the outputs are always in valid BCD representation (01-12 for hours, 00-59 for minutes and seconds).

This should pass the testbench simulation.'}
