The provided Karnaugh map can be implemented using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and three 2-to-1 multiplexers. The top_module implements the necessary logic using the 2-to-1 multiplexers and connects their outputs to the 4-to-1 multiplexer inputs.

The key steps are:
1. Implement the Karnaugh map using 2-to-1 multiplexers:
   - `w1 = (c & ~d) | (~c & d)` (for the 01 and 10 rows)
   - `w2 = (c & ~d) | (c & d)` (for the 00 and 01 rows)
   - `w3 = (c & d) | (~c & d)` (for the 11 and 10 rows)
2. Connect the 2-to-1 multiplexer outputs to the 4-to-1 multiplexer inputs:
   - `mux_in[0] = 1'b1` (for the 00 column)
   - `mux_in[1] = w1` (for the 01 column)
   - `mux_in[2] = (c & d) | (c & ~d)` (for the 11 column)
   - `mux_in[3] = w3` (for the 10 column)

This implementation uses the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers (three) to implement the given Karnaugh map.'}
