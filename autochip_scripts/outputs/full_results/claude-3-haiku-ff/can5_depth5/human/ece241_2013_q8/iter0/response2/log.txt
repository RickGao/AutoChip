The provided code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and consists of 3 states.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences by handling the cases where the input signal `x` transitions to 1 after the first or second 1 in the sequence has been detected.

The `state` register holds the current state of the FSM, while the `next_state` register holds the next state based on the current input `x` and the current state. The output `z` is asserted to 1 when the FSM reaches the STATE2 state and the current input `x` is 1, indicating that the "101" sequence has been detected.

The `aresetn` signal is used to asynchronously reset the FSM to the IDLE state, and the `z` output is set to 0 when the reset is active.'}
