The issue was in the STATE_SECOND_0 case, where the output z was being set to 1 when the next state was transitioning back to STATE_FIRST_1 instead of when the state was remaining in STATE_SECOND_0 with x == 0. The corrected code sets z = 1'b1 in the case where the state remains in STATE_SECOND_0 and x == 0.'}
