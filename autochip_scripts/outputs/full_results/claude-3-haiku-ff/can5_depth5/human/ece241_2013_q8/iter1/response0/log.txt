The main changes are:
1. In the `STATE_SECOND_0` case, the next state should transition to `STATE_INIT` when `x` is 0, instead of `STATE_SECOND_0`. This ensures that the FSM correctly resets when the "101" sequence is not followed by a 1.
2. The output `z` is asserted to 1 in the `STATE_SECOND_0` case when `x` is 1, which indicates that the "101" sequence has been detected.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the testbench simulation.'}
