The main issues with the original module were:

1. The sum register was not being updated correctly in the IDLE state. It should be sum <= sum + x;
2. The z output was not being set correctly. It should be z <= (state == DONE) ? ~sum + 1 : 0;

These corrections should resolve the errors you encountered in the simulation.'}
