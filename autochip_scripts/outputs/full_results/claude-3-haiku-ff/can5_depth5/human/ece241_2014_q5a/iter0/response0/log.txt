The provided Verilog module implements a one-input, one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The module has the following features:

1. It has two states: `IDLE` and `COMPUTE`.
2. The input `x` is a series of bits, with the least-significant bit arriving first.
3. The output `z` is the 2's complement of the input number.
4. The conversion begins when the asynchronous reset `areset` is released and stops when `areset` is asserted.
5. The module uses a register `num` to store the input number and a register `neg_num` to store the 2's complement of the input number.
6. The `next_state` logic transitions the state machine from `IDLE` to `COMPUTE` when `areset` is released, and from `COMPUTE` to `IDLE` when the entire input number has been processed.
7. The output `z` is set to the least-significant bit of the 2's complement number (`neg_num[0]`) when the state is `COMPUTE`, and to 0 when the state is `IDLE`.

The module is complete and should compile and function correctly as a serial 2's complementer.'}
