The provided Verilog module implements a 2's complementer Moore state machine with the following features:

1. The module has 4 ports: `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and `z`.
2. The module has 3 states: `IDLE`, `CONVERT`, and `DONE`.
3. In the `IDLE` state, the module waits for the `areset` signal to be deasserted, then transitions to the `CONVERT` state.
4. In the `CONVERT` state, the module shifts the input `x` into the `num` register, and computes the 2's complement of the number stored in `num` into the `negated` register. The least-significant bit of `negated` is driven to the output `z`.
5. When the most-significant bit of `num` is set, indicating the end of the input, the module transitions to the `DONE` state, where it continues to drive the least-significant bit of `negated` to the output `z`.
6. The module resets to the `IDLE` state when the `areset` signal is asserted.

The Verilog code provided is complete and should compile and function correctly.'}
