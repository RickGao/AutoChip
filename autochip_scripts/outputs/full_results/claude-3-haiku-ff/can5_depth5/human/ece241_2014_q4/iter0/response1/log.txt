The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit as described. It includes the following components:

1. The `top_module` which is the top-level module that instantiates the three D flip-flops and the logic gates.
2. The `dff` module which is a simple D flip-flop implementation with both `q` and `q_bar` outputs.
3. The logic gates implemented using Verilog assignments:
   - `d1 = x ^ q1`: XOR gate with input `x` and the output of the first flip-flop `q1`.
   - `d2 = x & q2_bar`: AND gate with input `x` and the complemented output of the second flip-flop `q2_bar`.
   - `d3 = x | q3_bar`: OR gate with input `x` and the complemented output of the third flip-flop `q3_bar`.
4. The XNOR gate implemented as `z = ~(q1 ^ q2 ^ q3)`.

The D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins, as per the problem statement.'}
