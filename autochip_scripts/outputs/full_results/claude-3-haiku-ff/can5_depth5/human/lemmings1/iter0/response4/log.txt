{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings behavior using a Moore finite state machine with two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`. 

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The module has two output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` to indicate the direction the Lemming is walking.
2. The state of the Lemming is stored in the `state` register, which can take the values `LEFT` or `RIGHT`.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.
4. If `areset` is high, the Lemming is reset to the `LEFT` state, and `walk_left` is set to 1 while `walk_right` is set to 0.
5. In the `LEFT` state, the Lemming walks left (`walk_left` = 1, `walk_right` = 0). If `bump_left` is high, the state transitions to `RIGHT`.
6. In the `RIGHT` state, the Lemming walks right (`walk_left` = 0, `walk_right` = 1). If `bump_right` is high, the state transitions to `LEFT`.

This implementation correctly models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
