{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect the boundaries of the PS/2 mouse protocol messages within a continuous byte stream. The module has the following states:

1. **Wait for start of message (state 0)**: In this state, the module waits for a byte with in[3] = 1, which indicates the start of a new message.
2. **Receive byte 2 (state 1)**: After detecting the start of the message, the module moves to this state to receive the second byte of the message.
3. **Receive byte 3 (state 2)**: After receiving the second byte, the module moves to this state to receive the third and final byte of the message.

The module uses a `count` variable to keep track of the current byte being received within the message. When the third byte is received, the `done` output is set to 1 for one cycle to signal the successful receipt of a complete message. The `done` output is then reset to 0.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and the `done` output when the `reset` input is high.'}
