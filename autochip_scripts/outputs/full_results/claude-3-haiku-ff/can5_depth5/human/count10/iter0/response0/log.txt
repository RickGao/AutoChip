This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The module uses a single `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. The block first checks if the `reset` input is high, and if so, it assigns the value `4'b0000` to the output register `q`. Otherwise, it checks if the current value of `q` is equal to `4'd9`, which is the maximum value for a 4-bit counter. If so, it resets `q` to `4'b0000`. If not, it increments the value of `q` by 1.'}
