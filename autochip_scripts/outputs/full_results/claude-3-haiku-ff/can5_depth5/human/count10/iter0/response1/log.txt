The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module takes two inputs: `clk` (clock) and `reset` (synchronous reset).
2. The output `q` is a 4-bit register that will hold the counter value.
3. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` input is high, the counter is set to 0.
   - If the counter value `q` is equal to 9, it is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

This implementation will correctly implement a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
