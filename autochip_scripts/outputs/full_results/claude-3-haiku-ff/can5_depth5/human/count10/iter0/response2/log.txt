The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module declaration matches the specification, with `input clk`, `input reset`, and `output reg [3:0] q`.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the code checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the `q` register is reset to `4'b0`.
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the code checks if the current value of `q` is equal to `4'd9`. If it is, the value of `q` is set to `4'b0`, effectively wrapping around to 0. Otherwise, the value of `q` is incremented by 1.

This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets the counter to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
