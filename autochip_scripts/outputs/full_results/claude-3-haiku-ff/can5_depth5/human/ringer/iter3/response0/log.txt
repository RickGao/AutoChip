{'assistant': 'I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Here is the corrected Verilog module:

module top_module(
    input ring, 
    input vibrate_mode,
    output reg ringer,
    output reg motor
);

always @(*) begin
    if (vibrate_mode) begin

    end
    else begin
        ringer = ring;
        motor = ~ring;
    end
end

endmodule

The issue with the previous solution was that it used combinational logic with the `assign` statements, which can cause timing issues. By using a `always` block with non-blocking assignments (`=`) instead, the module should now work as expected.'}
