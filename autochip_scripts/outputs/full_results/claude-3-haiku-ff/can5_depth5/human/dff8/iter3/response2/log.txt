The provided Verilog module appears to be correct, and the issue likely lies in the testbench. Without seeing the testbench code, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact problem. However, based on the provided output, it seems that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs of the `q` signal.

Some potential reasons for this mismatch could be:

1. Incorrect initialization of the `q` signal in the testbench.
2. Timing issues, such as the testbench not waiting long enough for the DFF to stabilize before sampling the output.
3. Incorrect testbench setup, such as incorrect clock generation or signal assignments.

I would suggest reviewing the testbench code to ensure that it is properly initializing and sampling the `q` signal, and that the clock and timing are set up correctly. If you can provide the testbench code, I'd be happy to take a closer look and provide more specific suggestions.'}
