The provided Verilog module appears to be correct and should not have any issues. The testbench simulation error indicating a mismatch in the output 'q' suggests that the issue may be in the testbench itself, or in the way the simulation is being conducted.

Without access to the full testbench code, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. However, you can try the following steps to further investigate and resolve the problem:

1. Double-check the testbench code to ensure that it is correctly generating the input signals and verifying the output correctly.
2. Inspect the timing of the signals in the simulation waveform to see if there are any timing-related issues.
3. Try running the simulation with a different simulation tool or environment to see if the issue is specific to the current setup.
4. Ensure that the Verilog module is being instantiated correctly in the testbench.

If the issue persists, you may need to provide the complete testbench code or additional information about the simulation setup for further assistance.'}
