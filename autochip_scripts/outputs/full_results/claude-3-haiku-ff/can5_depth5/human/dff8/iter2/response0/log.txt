The provided Verilog code for the `top_module` appears to be correct and should not have any issues. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the module, but the issue is likely in the testbench code rather than the module itself.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

1. Verify that the testbench code is correctly driving the inputs and checking the outputs of the `top_module`.
2. Ensure that the timing of the testbench is correctly aligned with the behavior of the `top_module`.
3. Check for any potential race conditions or glitches in the testbench or the module.
4. Verify that the simulation is running for a sufficient duration to capture the expected behavior.

If you are unable to identify the issue, please provide the testbench code, and I'll be happy to take a closer look and suggest any necessary modifications.'}
