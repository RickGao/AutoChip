This Verilog module implements the Lemmings behavior as described in the problem statement. It uses a Moore state machine with two states: `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`. The state is updated based on the input signals `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`.

The module has the following behavior:

1. When `areset` is high, the module is reset to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state, with `walk_left` set to 1 and `walk_right` set to 0.
2. In the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state, the module sets `walk_left` to 1 and `walk_right` to 0. If `bump_right` is high, the module transitions to the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state. If `ground` is low, the module sets `aaah` to 1 and remains in the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state.
3. In the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state, the module sets `walk_left` to 0 and `walk_right` to 1. If `bump_left` is high, the module transitions to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state. If `ground` is low, the module sets `aaah` to 1 and remains in the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state.
4. When the Lemming falls (`ground` is low), the module sets `aaah` to 1, and when the ground reappears (`ground` is high), the Lemming resumes walking in the same direction as before the fall.'}
