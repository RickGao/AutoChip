{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

The Verilog module implements the desired behavior of the Lemmings game using a Moore state machine. The module has the following features:

1. The module has three states: `WALK_LEFT`, `WALK_RIGHT`, and `FALLING`.
2. The `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `aaah` outputs are set based on the current state.
3. The next state logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`.
4. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and is reset to `WALK_LEFT` when `areset` is high.

The module should correctly model the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
