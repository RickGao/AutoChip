{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. It has the following features:

1. The module has the required inputs (clk, resetn, x, y) and outputs (f, g).
2. It defines the necessary states (STATE_A, STATE_B, STATE_C, STATE_D, STATE_E) to implement the FSM logic.
3. The `always` block for the state register updates the state based on the current state and inputs.
4. The `always` block for the next state logic and output assignments implements the state transition and output logic as per the specification.
5. The module correctly sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle after the reset is de-asserted, and sets the output `g` based on the sequence of `x` and `y` inputs as described in the specification.'}
