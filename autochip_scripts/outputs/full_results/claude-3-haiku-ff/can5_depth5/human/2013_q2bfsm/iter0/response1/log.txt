{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The main changes made are:

1. Added the necessary state definitions and the current/next state registers.
2. Implemented the state transition logic in the first `always` block, which updates the outputs and internal registers based on the current state and inputs.
3. Implemented the next state logic in the second `always` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and inputs.
4. Declared the output registers `f` and `g` as `reg` to allow them to be assigned within the `always` blocks.
5. Added the necessary logic to handle the x sequence detection and the y input timeout.

This Verilog module should now correctly implement the specified finite state machine behavior.'}
