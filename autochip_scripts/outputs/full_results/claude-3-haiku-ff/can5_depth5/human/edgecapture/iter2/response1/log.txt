The issue with the previous code was that it was setting the output bit to 1 whenever the input bit went from 0 to 1, instead of capturing the transition from 1 to 0. The corrected code now checks for the transition from 1 to 0 on the input and sets the corresponding output bit to 1 when this occurs. The output bit is then reset to 0 when the input bit goes from 1 to 0.'}
