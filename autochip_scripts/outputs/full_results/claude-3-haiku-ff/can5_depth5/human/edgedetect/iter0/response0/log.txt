The provided Verilog module correctly implements the positive edge detection logic for an 8-bit input vector. The key steps are:

1. Store the previous state of the input vector in the `in_prev` register.
2. On each positive edge of the clock, update the `in_prev` register with the current input vector `in`.
3. Compute the positive edge detection output `pedge` by performing a bitwise AND between the current input `in` and the negated previous input `~in_prev`. This ensures that the output bit is set only when the corresponding input bit transitions from 0 to 1.

This module should compile and function as expected.'}
