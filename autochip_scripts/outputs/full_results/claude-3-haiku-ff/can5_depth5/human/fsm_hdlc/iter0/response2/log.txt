{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

The module has the following states:

- `IDLE`: The initial state, where the FSM waits for the input to be 1.
- `WAIT1`, `WAIT2`, `WAIT3`, `WAIT4`, `WAIT5`: States that check for a sequence of 5 consecutive 1s, discarding the bit if the sequence is completed.
- `FLAG`: The state where a flag (beginning/end of a frame) is detected.
- `ERROR`: The state where an error (7 or more consecutive 1s) is detected.

The module sets the appropriate output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) based on the current state and the input.

The module also resets to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` signal is high, and the output signals are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.'}
