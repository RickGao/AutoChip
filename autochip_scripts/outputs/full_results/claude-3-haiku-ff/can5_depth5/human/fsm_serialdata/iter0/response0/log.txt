{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The module implements a finite state machine that receives a serial stream of bits and identifies when bytes have been correctly received. It handles the start bit, 8 data bits, and the stop bit, and outputs the correctly received data byte when the stop bit is detected.

The module has five states:
1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Counts the bits to ensure the start bit is received correctly.
3. `DATA`: Shifts in the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP`: Checks for the stop bit (1) and outputs the received data byte if it is correct.
5. `WAIT_STOP`: Waits for the stop bit to be detected if it was not found in the `STOP` state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset and sets the `done` output high when a complete byte has been received.'}
