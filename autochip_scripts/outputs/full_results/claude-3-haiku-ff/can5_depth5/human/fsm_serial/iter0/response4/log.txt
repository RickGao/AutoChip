{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine to detect and receive serial data bytes with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module handles the case where the stop bit does not appear when expected, and waits until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. It also includes a synchronous active-high reset.

The module has four states:
1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit (0).
2. `START`: Verifying the start bit and preparing to receive the data bits.
3. `DATA`: Receiving the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg`.
4. `STOP`: Verifying the stop bit (1) and setting the `done` output high if the stop bit is correct.

The module correctly handles the least significant bit first protocol by shifting the incoming bits into the `data_reg` in the correct order.'}
