{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine that identifies when bytes have been correctly received from a stream of bits. It includes the following states:

1. `STATE_IDLE`: The initial state, where the module waits for the detection of a start bit (0).
2. `STATE_START_BIT`: The module confirms the detection of the start bit (0) and transitions to the next state.
3. `STATE_DATA_BITS`: The module reads in the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
4. `STATE_STOP_BIT`: The module verifies the presence of the stop bit (1) and, if correct, sets the `done` output high to indicate a successful byte reception. If the stop bit is not detected, the module resets to the `STATE_IDLE` state and waits for the next start bit.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and associated registers when the `reset` input is high.'}
