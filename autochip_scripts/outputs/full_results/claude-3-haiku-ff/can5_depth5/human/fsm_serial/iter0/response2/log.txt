{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that correctly identifies the start bit, 8 data bits, and stop bit in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
2. `START`: Receiving the 8 data bits.
3. `STOP`: Verifying the stop bit.
4. `ERROR`: Handling the case where the stop bit is incorrect.

The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the number of bits received, and a `data_reg` variable to store the received data bits. The `done` output is set high when a complete byte has been received with the correct stop bit.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, which resets the state machine and all internal variables when the `reset` input is high.'}
