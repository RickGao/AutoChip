{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies when bytes have been correctly received from a serial communication protocol. The FSM has five states:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: Checks the start bit and waits for the 8 data bits.
3. `DATA`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, one bit per clock cycle.
4. `STOP`: Checks the stop bit (1) and verifies that it is correct. If the stop bit is correct, the `done` signal is set high.
5. `ERROR`: If the stop bit is not correct, the FSM enters this state and waits for the line to go high (1) before returning to the `IDLE` state.

The FSM also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the `reset` input resets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and clears the `data_reg` and `done` signals.'}
