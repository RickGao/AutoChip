{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The issue with the previous implementation was that the `done` signal was being set to high when the stop bit was expected, but the state machine was still in the STOP state. This meant that the testbench was seeing the `done` signal go high before the stop bit was actually received.

The fix is to set the `done` signal high only when the state machine has transitioned back to the IDLE state, indicating that the stop bit was successfully received. This ensures that the `done` signal is properly synchronized with the completion of the byte reception.'}
