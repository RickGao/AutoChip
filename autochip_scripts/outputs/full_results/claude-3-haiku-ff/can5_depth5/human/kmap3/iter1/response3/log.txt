module top_module (

always @(*) begin

end

endmodule

The key issues in the previous module were:

1. The case statement was using the wrong inputs. It should be checking the combination of `a` and `b` instead of `c` and `d`.
2. The default case for the don't-care condition was not necessary, as the Karnaugh map already specifies the desired output for all cases.

This corrected module should pass the testbench simulation without any errors.'}
