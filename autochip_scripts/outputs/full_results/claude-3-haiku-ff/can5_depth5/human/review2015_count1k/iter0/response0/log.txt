This Verilog module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a period of 1000 cycles. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The counter is implemented using a 10-bit register `q`, which can represent values from 0 to 999.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` signal is high, the counter is reset to 0.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. When the counter reaches 999 (the maximum value), it wraps around to 0.

This module should compile and function correctly as per the given specification.'}
