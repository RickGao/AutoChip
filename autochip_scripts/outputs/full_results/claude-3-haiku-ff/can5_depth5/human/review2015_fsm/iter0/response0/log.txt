This state machine implementation follows the requirements you outlined:

1. It waits for the start sequence "1101" to be detected on the `data` input.
2. Once the start sequence is detected, it asserts the `shift_ena` output for 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration bits.
3. After shifting in the duration, it asserts the `counting` output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until the `done_counting` input goes high.
4. When the counters are done, it asserts the `done` output to notify the user, and waits until the `ack` input goes high before resetting to the start state.
5. The state machine has a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to the start of the sequence detection.'}
