This finite-state machine implements the desired functionality as described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. It starts in the IDLE state, waiting for the 1101 pattern to be detected on the `data` input.
2. When the pattern is detected, it transitions to the START_SEQ state and asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles to shift in the 4-bit duration.
3. It then transitions to the COUNTING state, asserting `counting` to indicate the counters are running.
4. Once the `done_counting` signal is received, it transitions to the DONE state, asserting `done` to notify the user.
5. It remains in the DONE state until the `ack` signal is received, at which point it resets back to the IDLE state.
6. The state machine also has a synchronous reset that sets the state back to IDLE.'}
