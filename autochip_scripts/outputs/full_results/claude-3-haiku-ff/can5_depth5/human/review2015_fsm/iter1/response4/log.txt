The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The main changes are:
1. Added an additional state `WAIT_SHIFT` to wait for the shift count to reach 4 before transitioning to the `COUNTING` state.
2. Introduced a `shift_count` register to keep track of the number of bits shifted in.
3. Adjusted the transitions between states to match the expected behavior as per the timing diagram.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the test bench output.'}
