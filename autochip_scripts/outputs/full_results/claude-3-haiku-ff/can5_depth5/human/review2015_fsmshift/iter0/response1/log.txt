The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. It uses a 2-bit counter (`count`) to keep track of the number of clock cycles for which the `shift_ena` signal should be asserted. 

When the `reset` signal is high, the counter is initialized to 3 (2'd3), and `shift_ena` is set to 1 to enable the shift register for 4 clock cycles. After that, the counter is decremented on each clock cycle, and `shift_ena` is kept at 1 until the counter reaches 0, at which point `shift_ena` is set to 0 and remains so until the next reset.'}
