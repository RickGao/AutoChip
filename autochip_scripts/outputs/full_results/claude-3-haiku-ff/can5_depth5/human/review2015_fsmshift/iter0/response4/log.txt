The module you provided has been corrected to meet the requirements. The key changes are:

1. Added a `reg shift_ena` to hold the output signal.
2. Initialized the `state` to 0 on reset, and asserted `shift_ena` for the first 4 cycles.
3. Updated the `next_state` logic to cycle through the 4 states and then hold at the last state.
4. Set `shift_ena` to 0 after the 4 cycles are completed.

The module now correctly asserts `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then keeps it deasserted until the next reset.'}
