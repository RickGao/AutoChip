The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired functionality. It uses a finite state machine (FSM) with three states: IDLE, SHIFT_ENABLE, and SHIFT_DISABLE. 

- When the module is reset, it enters the SHIFT_ENABLE state and asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles.
- After the 4 clock cycles, it transitions to the SHIFT_DISABLE state, where `shift_ena` is deasserted.
- The module then remains in the IDLE state until the next reset occurs.

The module correctly handles the reset signal and the transition between the states. The `cycle_count` variable is used to keep track of the number of cycles the `shift_ena` signal is asserted.'}
