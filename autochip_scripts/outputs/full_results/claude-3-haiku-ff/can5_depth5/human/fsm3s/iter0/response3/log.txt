The provided Verilog module implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. The module includes a synchronous active-high reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The module defines four states (A, B, C, D) using a parameter declaration. The state transition logic is implemented in an always block that updates the next_state based on the current state and the input signal. The output logic is implemented in a separate always block that sets the output signal based on the current state.

The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset signal is used to reset the state to A.'}
