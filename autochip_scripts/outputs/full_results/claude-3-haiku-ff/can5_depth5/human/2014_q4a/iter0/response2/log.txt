```

The provided Verilog module `top_module` implements an n-bit shift register circuit with the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: Clock input
- `w`: Input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: Value to load into the register
- `E`: Enable signal for shifting
- `L`: Load signal to load the value from `R` input
- `Q`: Output of the current stage of the shift register

The module uses a single always block that handles two cases:

1. If the `L` input is high, the current stage's output `Q` is assigned the value from the `R` input, effectively loading the register.
2. If the `E` input is high, the current stage's output `Q` is assigned the value from the `w` input, effectively shifting the data through the register.

This implementation ensures that the n-bit shift register circuit operates correctly based on the given specification.'}
