This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

This Verilog code implements the described Finite State Machine (FSM) arbiter circuit. It has the following features:

1. Declares the state variables (`state` and `next_state`) and the output signals (`g[3:1]`).
2. Defines the state encoding using parameters: A, B, C, D.
3. Implements the state table in an `always` block that calculates the next state based on the current state and the input signals `r[3:1]`.
4. Implements the state flip-flops in another `always` block that updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock, with an active-low synchronous reset to state A.
5. Describes the output logic (`g[3:1]`) using continuous assignment statements, which set the grant signals based on the current state and the corresponding request signals `r[3:1]`.

The FSM follows the behavior described in the problem statement, granting access to the resource based on the priority of the requesting devices.'}
