The provided Verilog module specification is complete and does not have any compilation errors. The module implements a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. The key features are:

1. The `shift_ena` input controls shifting the data into the shift register, with the most significant bit being shifted in.
2. The `count_ena` input controls decrementing the value in the shift register.
3. The `q` output represents the current value of the four-bit shift register/counter.
4. The module uses a single `always` block to handle both the shift and count operations, based on the respective enable signals.
5. When both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are active, the module gives priority to the shift operation, as per the specification.

The provided Verilog code should correctly implement the desired functionality.'}
