The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following structure:

1. The `top_module` includes the necessary inputs (`clk`, `reset`, `s`, `w`) and the output (`z`).
2. The module uses three states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`.
3. The `state` and `next_state` registers are used to keep track of the current and next state of the FSM.
4. The `w_count` register is used to count the number of times `w` is 1 in the last three clock cycles while in `STATE_B`.
5. The `always` block for the `clk` signal handles the state updates, `w_count` updates, and the output `z` assignment.
6. The `always` block for the combinational logic handles the next state logic based on the current state and the input `s`.

The module correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement, setting the output `z` to 1 when `w` is 1 in exactly two of the last three clock cycles while in `STATE_B`, and to 0 otherwise.'}
