The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has the following inputs and outputs:
   - `clk`: clock signal
   - `reset`: synchronous reset signal
   - `s`: input signal that controls the transition from state A to state B
   - `w`: input signal that is examined in states B, C, and D
   - `z`: output signal that is set to 1 if `w` is 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles in state B

2. The module has four states, defined using localparam constants: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.

3. The `state` and `next_state` registers keep track of the current and next state of the FSM.

4. The `w_count` register keeps track of the number of times `w` is 1 in the three clock cycles in state B.

5. The `always` block that runs on the positive edge of the clock handles the state transitions and updates the output `z` based on the state and the value of `w_count`.
   - If `reset` is high, the FSM is reset to state A, `w_count` is set to 0, and `z` is set to 0.
   - If the current state is B, the `w_count` is updated based on the value of `w`.
   - If the current state is D, the value of `z` is set based on the value of `w_count`, and `w_count` is reset to 0.

6. The `always` block that handles the next state logic uses a case statement to determine the next state based on the current state and the value of `s`.

This implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement and uses the minimum number of states possible.'}
