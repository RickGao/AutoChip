The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The main changes are:

1. Moved the `w_count` update logic into the `case` statement for the current state, to ensure that the count is updated correctly in each state.
2. Moved the `z` assignment logic into the `STATE_D` case, to ensure that the output is set correctly in the appropriate state.
3. Added a default case in the `case` statement for the current state, to handle any other states that are not explicitly defined.

These changes should fix the issues with the original module and pass the provided testbench.'}
