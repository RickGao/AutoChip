This Verilog module is a simple 1-bit multiplexer that selects between two 100-bit input buses `a` and `b` based on the value of the `sel` input signal. If `sel` is 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of `a`, and if `sel` is 1, the output `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

The `always @(*)` block ensures that the output `out` is updated whenever any of the input signals change. The `if-else` statement inside the `always` block performs the actual multiplexing operation based on the value of `sel`.'}
