system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This module is a simple multiplexer that takes two inputs a and b, and a select signal sel. Depending on the value of sel, the output out will be either a or b. If sel is 0, then out will be equal to a, and if sel is 1, then out will be equal to b. This module is useful for selecting between two different inputs depending on the value of the select signal.

module top_module (
	input [99:0] a,
	input [99:0] b,
	input sel,
	output [99:0] out
);
