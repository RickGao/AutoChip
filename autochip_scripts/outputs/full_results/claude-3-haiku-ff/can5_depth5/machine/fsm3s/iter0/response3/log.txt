This Verilog module implements a 4-state Finite State Machine (FSM) based on the given specification. The module has three inputs: `clk`, `in`, and `reset`, and one output: `out`.

The module uses two registers: `state` and `next_state`. The `state` register stores the current state of the FSM, while the `next_state` register stores the next state based on the current state and the value of the `in` input.

The "Next state logic" section defines the transitions between the four states (A, B, C, and D) based on the value of the `in` input. The "State register" section updates the `state` register based on the `next_state` value and the `reset` input.

The "Output logic" section sets the `out` signal to 1 when the FSM is in the D state, and 0 otherwise.'}
