The issue in the original module was that the connections for the inputs to the `and` gates were swapped. The `x` input should go to the `a` input of the first `and` gate, and the `y` input should go to the `b` input. Similarly, for the second `and` gate, the `x` input should go to the `b` input, and the `y` input should go to the `a` input.

This correction should resolve the mismatches in the simulation.'}
