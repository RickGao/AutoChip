module top_module (

assign Y2 = y[1] & ~w;
assign Y4 = y[2] & y[3] & y[5] & y[6] & w;

endmodule

The issue with the previous module was that the input port for `y` was declared as `[6:1]`, but the bits being used in the `Y4` assignment were `[2]`, `[3]`, `[5]`, and `[6]`. This meant that the MSB bit `y[6]` was not being used, and the LSB bit `y[1]` was being used twice (once for `Y2` and once for the unused `Y4`).

By changing the input port declaration for `y` to `[6:0]`, the entire 7-bit input can be used correctly in the module.'}
