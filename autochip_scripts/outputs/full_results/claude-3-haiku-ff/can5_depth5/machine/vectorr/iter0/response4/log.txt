The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

The module takes an 8-bit input `in` and assigns the output `out` based on the reverse order of the input bits. Specifically, the following assignments are made:

- `out[0]` is assigned the value of `in[7]`
- `out[1]` is assigned the value of `in[6]`
- `out[2]` is assigned the value of `in[5]`
- `out[3]` is assigned the value of `in[4]`
- `out[4]` is assigned the value of `in[3]`
- `out[5]` is assigned the value of `in[2]`
- `out[6]` is assigned the value of `in[1]`
- `out[7]` is assigned the value of `in[0]`

This effectively reverses the order of the 8-bit input and assigns the result to the output `out`.'}
