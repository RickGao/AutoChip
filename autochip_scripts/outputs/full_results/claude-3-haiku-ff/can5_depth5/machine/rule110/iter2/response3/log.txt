The issue with the previous module was that the bitwise operation to compute the new value of `q` was incorrect. The correct expression is:

`q <= ({q[510:0], 1'b0}) ^ (q[511:1] & ~q[511:0]);`

This performs the bitwise operations as specified in the problem statement, where the new value of `q` is computed based on the current value of `q` and the bitwise operations.'}
