```

The key changes are:

1. Declared the `state` register as a 3-bit register to represent the 4 states and the `Done` state.
2. Added the state transition logic in the first `always` block, where the state transitions from `B0` to `B1` to `B2` to `B3` and then to the `Done` state.
3. Added a default case in the state transition logic to transition to the `Done` state for any other state.
4. Added the second `always` block to set the `shift_ena` output based on the current state.

This module should now correctly implement the state machine and generate the `shift_ena` signal as per the specification.'}
