The main changes are:

1. Made the `f` and `g` outputs as `reg` type to allow assignments within the always block.
2. Corrected the state transitions based on the provided descriptions.
3. Moved the output assignments (`f` and `g`) to a separate always block to ensure they are updated correctly based on the current state.

The updated module should now pass the provided testbench.'}
