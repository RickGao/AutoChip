```verilog
module top_module (

```

The original module had a few issues:
1. It was missing the `always` block to assign the output `out` based on the input `sel`.
2. The logic inside the `always` block was incorrect. It should assign `b` to `out` when `sel` is 0, and `a` to `out` when `sel` is 1.

The corrected module includes the `always` block with the proper logic to determine the value of `out` based on the value of `sel`.'}
