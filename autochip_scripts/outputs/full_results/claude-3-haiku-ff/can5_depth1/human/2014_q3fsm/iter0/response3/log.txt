The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. `STATE_A`: This is the reset state where the FSM remains as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it transitions to `STATE_B`.
2. `STATE_B`: In this state, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles.
3. `STATE_C`: If `w = 1` in exactly two of the three clock cycles in `STATE_B`, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle (`STATE_C`), and then transitions back to `STATE_B`.

The module uses a `w_count` variable to keep track of the number of times `w = 1` in the three clock cycles in `STATE_B`. The `z` output is set to 1 if `w_count` is 2 in `STATE_C`, and 0 otherwise.

The `next_state` logic is implemented in the always block that handles the state transitions. The reset behavior is handled in the first always block, where the state is set to `STATE_A` and the `z` output is cleared when `reset` is high.'}
