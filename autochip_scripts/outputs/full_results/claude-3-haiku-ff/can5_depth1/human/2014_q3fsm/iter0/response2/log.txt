The finite state machine has two states: A and B.

State A:
- The FSM remains in state A as long as `s = 0`.
- When `s = 1`, the FSM transitions to state B and resets the `count` variable to 0.

State B:
- In state B, the FSM examines the value of the input `w` in the next three clock cycles.
- The `count` variable keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w = 1`.
- If `w = 1` in exactly two of these three clock cycles, then the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 in the following clock cycle.
- After the three clock cycles, the FSM transitions back to state B and resets the `count` variable to 0.

The reset is active high and synchronous, and it sets the state to A and the output `z` to 0.'}
