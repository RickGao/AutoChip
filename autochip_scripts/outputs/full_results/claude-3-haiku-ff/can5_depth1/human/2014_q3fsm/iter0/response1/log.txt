The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles.

The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The module above implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement using three states: A, B, and C. The state transitions and output logic are handled in the `always @(state, s, w)` block.

Here's a breakdown of the module:

1. The module has 5 ports: `clk`, `reset`, `s`, `w`, and `z`.
2. The `state` and `next_state` registers keep track of the current and next state of the FSM.
3. The `w_count` register keeps track of the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1 in state B.
4. The `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block updates the state register based on the reset signal or the next state.
5. The `always @(state, s, w)` block handles the state transitions and output logic:
   - In state A, if `s` is 1, the next state is B, and `w_count` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the next state remains A, and `w_count` is reset to 0. The output `z` is always 0 in state A.
   - In state B, if `w` is 1, `w_count` is incremented. If `w_count` is 2, the next state is C, and `z` is set to 1. If `w_count` is 3, the next state is B, `w_count` is reset to 0, and `z` is set to 0. Otherwise, the next state remains B, and `z` is set to 0.
   - In state C, the next state is B, `w_count` is reset to 0, and `z` is set to 0.
   - In the default case, the next state is A, `w_count` is reset to 0, and `z` is set to 0.

This module should correctly implement the finite state machine described in the problem statement.'}
