The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

The main changes are:
1. In state B, the count is incremented only when w is 1, and reset to 0 when w is 0.
2. In state C, the count is also incremented when w is 1, and reset to 0 when w is 0.
3. In state B, the output z is set to 1 only when the count reaches 2.
4. In state C, the output z is always 0.

This should fix the issues in the original module and pass the testbench.'}
