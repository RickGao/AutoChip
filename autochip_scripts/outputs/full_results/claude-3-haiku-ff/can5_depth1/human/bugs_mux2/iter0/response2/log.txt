The original code had a bug in the assignment statement for the output `out`. The correct Verilog code for an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer is provided above.

The key differences are:

1. The output `out` is declared as a `reg [7:0]` type, as it is an 8-bit wide output that needs to be assigned a value.
2. The assignment to `out` is done inside an `always` block with a sensitivity list of `(*)`, which means it is a combinational logic block.
3. Inside the `always` block, the value of `out` is assigned based on the value of the select signal `sel`. If `sel` is 1, `out` is assigned the value of `b`, otherwise it is assigned the value of `a`.

This implementation ensures that the output `out` correctly selects between the 8-bit inputs `a` and `b` based on the value of the select signal `sel`.'}
