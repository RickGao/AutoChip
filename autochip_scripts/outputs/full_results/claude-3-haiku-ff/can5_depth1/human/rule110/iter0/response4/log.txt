{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton in Verilog. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` takes the following inputs and outputs:
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `load`: An active-high signal that indicates the system should load the state from `data`.
   - `data`: A 512-bit input vector that represents the initial state of the 512-cell system.
   - `q`: A 512-bit output vector that represents the current state of the 512-cell system.

2. In the `always` block, the module performs the following actions:
   - If `load` is high, the current state `q` is assigned the value of `data`.
   - If `load` is low, the module computes the next state of each cell based on the Rule 110 table.
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are handled separately, as their neighbors (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are assumed to be 0 (off).
   - For the remaining cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is computed using the Rule 110 logic: `(~q[i-1] & q[i]) | (q[i-1] & ~q[i+1]) | (~q[i] & q[i+1])`.

The provided code should correctly implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton and advance the state of the 512-cell system by one time step on each clock cycle, unless the `load` signal is high, in which case the state is loaded from the `data` input.'}
