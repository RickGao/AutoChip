{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

This Verilog module implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system. The `load` input allows the initial state of the system to be loaded from the `data` input. On each clock cycle, the next state of each cell is computed based on the Rule 110 logic, and the updated state is stored in the `q` output.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The use of a `next_state` register to store the computed next state of each cell.
2. The `for` loop that iterates over the 512 cells and computes the next state based on the Rule 110 logic.
3. The special handling for the boundary conditions (cells at indices 0 and 511) by assuming the neighboring cells outside the system are off (0).
4. The update of the `q` register with the `next_state` at the end of each clock cycle, unless the `load` input is active.

This implementation should correctly simulate the Rule 110 cellular automaton.'}
