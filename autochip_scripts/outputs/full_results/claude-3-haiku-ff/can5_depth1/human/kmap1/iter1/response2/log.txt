The issue with the previous module was that the Karnaugh map provided did not completely match the logic expression that was implemented. The correct logic expression based on the given Karnaugh map is:

(a & ~b & ~c) | (~a & b & ~c) | (~a & ~b & c) | (a & b & ~c)

This expression correctly captures the logic represented by the Karnaugh map.'}
