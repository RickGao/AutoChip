```

The provided Verilog module implements the given circuit. It consists of the following components:

1. An XOR gate that takes `in` and the output `out` as inputs, and generates the `xor_output`.
2. A D flip-flop that is positive edge-triggered by the `clk` input. The D input of the flip-flop is connected to the `xor_output`, and the flip-flop's output is assigned to the `out` signal.

This way, the output `out` is updated on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, and is the result of the XOR operation between the `in` input and the previous value of `out`.'}
