The corrected Verilog module has the following changes:

1. The `always` blocks are missing an `else` condition, which has been added to ensure the output registers are properly assigned.
2. The comparison operator `~` (bitwise NOT) has been replaced with `!` (logical NOT) to correctly check for the opposite of the `arrived` condition.

These corrections ensure the module compiles and behaves as expected.'}
