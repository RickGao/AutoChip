The provided Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine with two states, one input, and one output. The reset state is set to B, and the reset is active-high synchronous.

The module defines the states using the localparam construct, with A representing state 0 and B representing state 1. The state is stored in the `state` register.

The state transition logic is implemented using a `case` statement inside an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock. The transitions are defined based on the current state and the input value. If the reset signal is active, the state is set to B.

The output logic is implemented using another `always` block that sets the `out` output based on the current state. When the state is B, the output is set to 1, and when the state is A, the output is set to 0.'}
