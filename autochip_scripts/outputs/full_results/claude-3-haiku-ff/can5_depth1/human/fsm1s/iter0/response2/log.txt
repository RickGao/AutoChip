This Verilog module implements the given Moore state machine specification. The module has three inputs: `clk` (the clock signal), `in` (the input signal), and `reset` (the asynchronous reset signal). It has one output: `out` (the output signal).

The module uses two state variables: `current_state` and `next_state`. The `current_state` variable represents the current state of the state machine, and the `next_state` variable represents the next state based on the current state and the input signal.

The `always` block that updates the `current_state` variable uses the `posedge` (positive edge) of the clock signal and the `reset` signal to determine the next state. If `reset` is high, the state machine is set to the reset state `STATE_B`. Otherwise, the `current_state` is updated to the `next_state`.

The second `always` block determines the `next_state` and the output `out` based on the `current_state` and the `in` signal. The case statement handles the logic for each state, updating the `next_state` and setting the `out` signal accordingly.'}
