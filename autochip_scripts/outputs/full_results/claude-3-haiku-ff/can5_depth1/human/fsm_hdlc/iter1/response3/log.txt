{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput in,\n\toutput disc,\n\toutput flag,\n\toutput err);'}

The main changes are:

1. I added the `reg` keyword to the output signals `disc`, `flag`, and `err` to make them registers.
2. In the `S_5_1` state, I moved the assignment of `disc = 1'b1` to the case when `in == 1'b1`. This ensures that the `disc` signal is only asserted when the condition for discarding a bit is met.
3. I fixed the logic for the `flag` and `err` signals to ensure they are asserted correctly based on the state machine transitions.

These changes should fix the issues reported in the testbench output and pass the simulation.'}
