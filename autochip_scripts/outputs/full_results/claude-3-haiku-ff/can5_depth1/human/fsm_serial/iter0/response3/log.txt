{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module provided above implements a finite state machine that can identify correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following features:

1. It has four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.
2. In the IDLE state, it waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. Once the start bit is detected, it transitions to the START state to confirm that the start bit is valid.
4. In the DATA state, it reads the 8 data bits, with the least significant bit received first.
5. After the 8 data bits are received, it transitions to the STOP state to verify the stop bit (1).
6. If the stop bit is valid, it sets the `done` output to 1 and transitions back to the IDLE state, ready for the next byte.
7. If the stop bit is not valid, it remains in the IDLE state and waits for the next start bit.
8. The module also includes a synchronous active-high reset signal that resets the state machine and the internal registers.

This implementation ensures that the receiver can correctly identify and process each byte in the serial data stream, even if the stop bit is not present when expected.'}
