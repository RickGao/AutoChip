{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the module waits for the start bit.
2. `START`: The state where the module reads the 8 data bits, one at a time.
3. `STOP`: The state where the module verifies the stop bit.
4. `ERROR`: The state where the module waits for the stop bit to be detected after an error.

The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the number of bits received, and a `data_reg` variable to store the 8 data bits. The `done` output is set high when a byte has been correctly received.

The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset, which resets the state machine and the internal variables.'}
