{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine for the serial communication protocol as described. The module has the following features:

1. It has three main states: IDLE, START, and DATA.
2. In the IDLE state, it waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. In the START state, it checks if the next 9 bits are valid, with the first bit being 0 (start bit) and the last bit being 1 (stop bit).
4. In the DATA state, it shifts in the 8 data bits, with the least significant bit being received first.
5. In the STOP state, it checks if the stop bit is 1. If so, it sets the `done` output high and goes back to the IDLE state.
6. The module also includes a synchronous reset that resets the state machine and the data register.

The provided Verilog module should correctly identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits, as per the given specification.'}
