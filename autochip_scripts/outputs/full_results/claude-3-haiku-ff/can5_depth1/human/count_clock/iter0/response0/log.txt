This Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with am/pm indicator. It has the following features:

1. The clock is clocked by the `clk` input signal, and the `ena` input signal is used to indicate when the clock should increment (once per second).
2. The `reset` input signal is a synchronous reset that sets the clock to "12:00 AM".
3. The `pm` output indicates whether the current time is PM (`pm = 1`) or AM (`pm = 0`).
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the current time in BCD format, with `hh` representing hours (01-12), `mm` representing minutes (00-59), and `ss` representing seconds (00-59).
5. The module correctly handles the rollover from "11:59:59 PM" to "12:00:00 AM" and the rollover from "12:59:59 AM" to "01:00:00 AM".'}
