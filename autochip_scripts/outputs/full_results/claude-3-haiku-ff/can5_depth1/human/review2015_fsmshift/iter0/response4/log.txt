The key changes made are:

1. Added a `reg shift_ena` output to track the shift enable signal.
2. Defined a `RESET_COUNT` parameter to determine the number of cycles to assert `shift_ena` after reset.
3. Added a state machine with 4 states to track the reset count and control the `shift_ena` signal accordingly.
4. In the `always @(posedge clk)` block, the reset condition sets the state to 0 and asserts `shift_ena`, and the non-reset condition updates the state and deasserts `shift_ena` after the reset count is reached.
5. The `always @(*)` block defines the next state transitions for the state machine.

This implementation ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles after reset, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
