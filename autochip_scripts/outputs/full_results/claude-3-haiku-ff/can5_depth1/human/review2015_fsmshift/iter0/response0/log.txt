The key changes made are:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output, since it needs to be assigned in the always block.
2. Added a `localparam` for the `ENABLE_CYCLES` value, which is set to 4.
3. Added the logic to assert `shift_ena` for 4 cycles whenever the state transitions from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and then deassert it when the state transitions from 3 to 0.
4. Added the default case in the `next_state` assignment to handle any unexpected state values.

This module should now correctly implement the desired functionality of asserting `shift_ena` for 4 cycles when the FSM is reset, and then for 4 cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected.'}
