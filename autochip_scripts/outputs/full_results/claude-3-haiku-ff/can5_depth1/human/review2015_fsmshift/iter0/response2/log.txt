The module you provided has the following issues:

1. The `shift_ena` signal is not being assigned properly. It should be a registered output.
2. The reset behavior is not specified correctly. When reset is active, the module should assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles and then deassert it.

The corrected module addresses these issues. The key changes are:

1. Declared `shift_ena` as a `reg` type output.
2. Added a counter `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles after reset.
3. In the reset case, the module sets `shift_ena` to 1 and increments the counter. Once the counter reaches 3 (4 clock cycles), the module sets `shift_ena` to 0.
4. In the non-reset case, the module checks the counter value and sets `shift_ena` accordingly.

This should provide the desired functionality for the shift register control FSM.'}
