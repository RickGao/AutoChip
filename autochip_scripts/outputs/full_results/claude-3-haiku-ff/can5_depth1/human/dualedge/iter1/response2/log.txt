The issue with the previous implementation was that the assignment to `q` was not being updated correctly. The final `always` block now checks the values of `q_posedge` and `q_negedge` and assigns the appropriate value to `q` based on which one has a different value. This ensures that `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock.'}
