The provided Verilog module specification for a dual-edge triggered flip-flop cannot be directly implemented in FPGA hardware, as FPGA devices do not natively support dual-edge triggered flip-flops. However, we can create a functionally equivalent circuit using two separate always blocks, one for the positive edge and one for the negative edge of the clock.

The corrected Verilog module uses two always blocks, one for the posedge of the clock and one for the negedge of the clock. In the posedge block, the output `q` is assigned the input `d`, and in the negedge block, the output `q` is also assigned the input `d`. This ensures that the flip-flop updates its state on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
