{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has two states: `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`. The state transitions are based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs.

In the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state, the Lemming is walking left, and if it receives a `bump_right` signal, it transitions to the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state. In the `STATE_WALK_RIGHT` state, the Lemming is walking right, and if it receives a `bump_left` signal, it transitions to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state.

The module also includes an asynchronous reset signal `areset`, which resets the state machine to the `STATE_WALK_LEFT` state and sets the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs accordingly.'}
