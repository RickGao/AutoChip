{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, which represent the Lemming walking left and right, respectively. The inputs `bump_left` and `bump_right` are used to determine when the Lemming should switch directions, and the outputs `walk_left` and `walk_right` indicate the Lemming's current direction.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the asynchronous reset signal `areset`. If `areset` is high, the state is set to `LEFT`, and the Lemming is set to walk left. Otherwise, the state is updated based on the current state and the values of `bump_left` and `bump_right`. If the Lemming is in the `LEFT` state and `bump_left` is high, the state is updated to `RIGHT`, causing the Lemming to walk right. Similarly, if the Lemming is in the `RIGHT` state and `bump_right` is high, the state is updated to `LEFT`, causing the Lemming to walk left.

The output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` are updated based on the current state, ensuring that only one of the signals is high at a time.'}
