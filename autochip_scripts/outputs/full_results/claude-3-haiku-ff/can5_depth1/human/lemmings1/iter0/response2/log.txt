{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Lemmings finite state machine behavior as described in the problem statement. The module has two states, `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the Lemming's walking direction. The `state` variable keeps track of the current state. 

The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset signal `areset`. When `areset` is high, the state is set to `LEFT`, and the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set accordingly.

In the normal operation, the state transitions based on the `bump_left` and `bump_right` inputs. If the Lemming is bumped on the left, it switches to the `RIGHT` state, and if it's bumped on the right, it switches to the `LEFT` state. The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set based on the current state.

The module handles all the cases specified in the problem statement correctly.'}
