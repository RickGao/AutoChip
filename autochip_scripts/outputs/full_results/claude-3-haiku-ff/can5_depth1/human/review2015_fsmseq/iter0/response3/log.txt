The Verilog module provided here implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, and it remains at 1 until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module has five states:
- `S0`: Waiting for the first '1' in the sequence
- `S1`: Waiting for the second '1' in the sequence
- `S2`: Waiting for the '0' in the sequence
- `S3`: Waiting for the final '1' in the sequence
- `S4`: The sequence has been found, set `start_shifting` to 1 and remain in this state until reset

The `always` blocks handle the state transitions and the output logic. The module uses a synchronous reset, so when `reset` is high, the module resets to the initial state `S0` and `start_shifting` is set to 0.'}
