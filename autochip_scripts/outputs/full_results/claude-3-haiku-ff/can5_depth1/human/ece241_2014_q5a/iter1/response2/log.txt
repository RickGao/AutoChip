The main changes made are:
1. Increased the bit_count from 3 to 4 bits to handle 8-bit input numbers.
2. Changed the condition for transitioning from CONVERT to DONE state from bit_count == 7 to bit_count == 8, as the input is 8 bits.
3. Added a next_state assignment in the CONVERT state to ensure the state machine stays in the CONVERT state until the 8-bit input is fully processed.

These changes should address the issues in the original module and pass the testbench.'}
