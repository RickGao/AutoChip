The completed Verilog module for a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 with a reset input is provided above. The key elements are:

1. The module declaration with the input and output ports.
2. The `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. The conditional statement that checks for the reset input. If reset is high, the counter is set to 0.
4. The counter logic that increments the output `q` from 0 to 15 and wraps around to 0 when it reaches 15.

The counter is implemented using a single 4-bit register `q` that is updated on every positive clock edge. The reset input sets the counter to 0, and the counter increments until it reaches the maximum value of 15, at which point it wraps around to 0.'}
