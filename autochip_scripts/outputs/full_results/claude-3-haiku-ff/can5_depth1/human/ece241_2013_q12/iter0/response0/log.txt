{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

            default: Z = 1'bx; // undefined behavior
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

The key points of this implementation are:

1. The 8-bit shift register is implemented using a single `reg [7:0] Q` variable, with the shift logic in the first `always` block.
2. The 3-input logic function is implemented using a multiplexer in the second `always` block, which selects the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the `A`, `B`, and `C` inputs.
3. The `default` case in the multiplexer is set to an `x` value to handle any undefined behavior.

This module should correctly implement the specified 8x1 memory and 3-input logic function.'}
