{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

Explanation of the corrections:

1. I added the `reg` keyword to the output declarations `f` and `g` to make them writable registers.
2. I added four state parameters to represent the four states of the finite state machine.
3. I added the state register `state` and the next state register `next_state` to keep track of the current and next state.
4. I added a counter `x_count` to keep track of the sequence of 1, 0, 1 on the `x` input.
5. The `always @(posedge clk)` block handles the state transitions and the output assignments based on the current state and the input signals.
6. The `always @(*)` block implements the state transition logic and the output assignments for each state.
7. In the `STATE_D` case, I corrected the logic to maintain `g = 1` if `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, and set `g = 0` permanently if `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles.'}
