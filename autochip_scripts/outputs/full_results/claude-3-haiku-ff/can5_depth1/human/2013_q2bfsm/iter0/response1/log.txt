{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The corrected Verilog module addresses the following issues:

1. Declared the state variables as `reg [1:0] state;` to represent the four states.
2. Defined the state constants using `localparam` for better readability.
3. Implemented the synchronous reset behavior in the `always` block, resetting the state to `A` and setting `f` and `g` to 0 when `resetn` is not asserted.
4. Implemented the state machine logic in the `case` statement, transitioning between the states based on the input conditions.
5. Correctly set the outputs `f` and `g` based on the state transitions.
6. Handled the case where `x` does not transition from 1 to 0 to 1 within three clock cycles by resetting the state to `A`.
7. Handled the case where `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles after `g` is set to 1 by setting `g` to 0 permanently.

The corrected module should now work as per the given specification.'}
