{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol with one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The module takes in the serial data stream on the `in` input, and outputs the correctly received data byte on the `out_byte` output when the `done` output is asserted.

The FSM has the following states:
- `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit (0) to appear on the `in` input.
- `START`: Verifies that the start bit is present.
- `DATA`: Shifts in the 8 data bits, least significant bit first, into the `data_reg` register.
- `STOP`: Checks that the stop bit (1) is present, and if so, asserts the `done` output and updates the `out_byte` output.
- `WAIT`: If the stop bit is not present when expected, the FSM enters this state and waits until a stop bit is found before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, triggered by the `reset` input, which resets the state machine and internal registers to their initial values.'}
