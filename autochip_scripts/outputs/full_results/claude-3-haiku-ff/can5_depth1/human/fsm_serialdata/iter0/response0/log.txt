{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The module has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: The module is waiting for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START`: The module has detected the start bit and is waiting for the 8 data bits to be received.
3. `DATA`: The module is receiving the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP`: The module has received the 8 data bits and is waiting for the stop bit (1) to be detected.
5. `ERROR`: The module has detected an error in the serial communication, such as a missing stop bit.

The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the number of data bits received, and a `data_reg` variable to store the received data byte. The `out_byte` output is updated with the received data byte when the `done` output is asserted, indicating that a byte has been successfully received.

The module also includes a synchronous reset signal `reset` that resets the state machine and all internal variables to their initial values.'}
