{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine that identifies correctly received bytes in a serial communication protocol. The module takes in the serial input `in`, a clock `clk`, and a reset `reset` signal. It outputs the correctly received data byte `out_byte` and a `done` signal to indicate when a byte has been successfully received.

The module has four main states:
1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. `START_BIT`: Confirming the start bit and preparing to receive the 8 data bits.
3. `DATA_BITS`: Receiving the 8 data bits and storing them in the `data_reg`.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifying the stop bit (1) and outputting the received byte.

The module uses a `bit_count` variable to keep track of the current position within the byte, and a `data_reg` to store the received data. When the stop bit is confirmed, the module outputs the received byte in `out_byte` and asserts the `done` signal.

If the stop bit is not detected when expected, the module waits until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. The module also includes a synchronous reset that clears the state and resets all the variables.'}
