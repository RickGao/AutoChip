The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as shown above. The module takes a 1024-bit wide input vector `in` and an 8-bit `sel` input, and outputs a 4-bit `out` signal. The `out` signal is assigned by selecting the appropriate 4-bit slice from the `in` vector, based on the value of `sel`. The formula `((sel * 4) + 3) : (sel * 4)` calculates the correct range of bits to select from the `in` vector for the current value of `sel`.'}
