{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput [3:0] in,\n\toutput reg [1:0] pos\n);"}

The provided Verilog code for the 4-bit priority encoder is correct and should work as expected. The `always @(*)` block checks the input bits in a priority order, starting from the most significant bit (bit 3) to the least significant bit (bit 0), and sets the `pos` output accordingly.

If none of the input bits are high (i.e., the input is 0), the output `pos` is set to 2'b00, as per the problem statement.'}
