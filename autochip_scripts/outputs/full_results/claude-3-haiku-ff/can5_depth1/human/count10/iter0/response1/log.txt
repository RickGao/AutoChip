The Verilog code you provided is correct and should work as a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The key aspects of the module are:

1. The `q` output is defined as a 4-bit register (`output reg [3:0] q`).
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the `if` statement checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the `q` register is set to 0.
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the code checks if the current value of `q` is 9. If it is, the `q` register is set back to 0, effectively wrapping around to 0 after reaching 9.
5. If the current value of `q` is not 9, the `q` register is incremented by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets to 0 when the `reset` input is high.'}
