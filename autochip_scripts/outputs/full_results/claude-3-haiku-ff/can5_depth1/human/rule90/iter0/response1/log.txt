{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 \n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. The key aspects of the module are:

1. The `top_module` takes in a clock signal `clk`, a load signal `load`, and a 512-bit input `data`. It outputs a 512-bit value `q` representing the current state of the cellular automaton.
2. On the positive edge of the clock signal, the module checks the `load` signal. If `load` is high, the current state `q` is updated with the input `data`.
3. If `load` is low, the module updates the state of the cellular automaton by following the Rule 90 update rule:
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are special cases. The first cell is updated with the value of the second cell (`q[1]`), and the last cell is always set to 0.
   - For the intermediate cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the new state is calculated as the XOR of the two neighboring cells (`q[i-1]` and `q[i+1]`).
4. The module uses a `for` loop to efficiently update all the intermediate cells in the automaton.

This implementation correctly handles the boundary conditions (the first and last cells) and updates the state of the cellular automaton according to the Rule 90 specification.'}
