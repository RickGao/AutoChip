The main issues with the previous module were:
1. The state parameter was not wide enough (3 bits instead of 4).
2. The pattern detection was incorrect - it should check for the full 4-bit pattern of 1101, not just the last 4 bits.
3. The state transition from SHIFT to WAIT was incorrect - it should check for the full 4-bit pattern of 1111, not just the last 4 bits.

I've made the following changes:
1. Increased the state parameter to 3 bits to accommodate all the states.
2. Changed the pattern detection to check for the full 4-bit pattern of 1101 in the IDLE state.
3. Changed the state transition from SHIFT to WAIT to check for the full 4-bit pattern of 1111.
4. Added a default case to the state transition logic to ensure the state machine goes to the IDLE state if none of the other conditions are met.

These changes should fix the issues with the previous module and pass the provided testbench.'}
