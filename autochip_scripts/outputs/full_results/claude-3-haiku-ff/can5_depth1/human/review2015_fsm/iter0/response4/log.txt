The provided Verilog module implements the finite-state machine that controls the timer as per the given specifications. The module has the following states:

1. IDLE: This is the initial state where the state machine waits for the input pattern 1101 to be detected.
2. DETECT: This state is not used in the provided implementation, as the pattern detection logic is implemented in the IDLE state.
3. SHIFT: When the 1101 pattern is detected, the state machine transitions to this state and asserts the `shift_ena` signal for 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration value.
4. WAIT: After the duration value is shifted in, the state machine transitions to this state and asserts the `counting` signal to indicate that the counters are running.
5. NOTIFY: When the counting is done (indicated by the `done_counting` signal), the state machine transitions to this state and asserts the `done` signal to notify the user. The state machine then waits for the user acknowledgment (`ack`) before transitioning back to the IDLE state.

The module also has a synchronous reset that sets the state to IDLE and resets the pattern register.'}
