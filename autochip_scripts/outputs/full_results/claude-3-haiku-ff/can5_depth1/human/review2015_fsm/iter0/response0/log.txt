After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog module implements the finite-state machine as described in the problem statement. The main states are:

1. `IDLE`: Waits for the start pattern of `1101` to be detected on the `data` input.
2. `DETECT_PATTERN`: Asserts the `shift_ena` signal to start shifting in the duration value.
3. `SHIFT_DURATION`: Shifts in the 4-bit duration value and then deasserts `shift_ena` and asserts `counting`.
4. `WAIT_COUNTING`: Waits for the `done_counting` signal to be asserted, indicating the counters have finished.
5. `NOTIFY_USER`: Asserts the `done` signal to notify the user, and waits for the `ack` signal to be asserted before returning to the `IDLE` state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset that returns the state machine to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` signal is asserted.'}
