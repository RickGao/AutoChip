This Verilog module implements a simple 0 to 999 counter with the following functionality:

1. The module has three ports: `clk` (input clock), `reset` (input reset), and `q` (output 10-bit register).
2. The module is always triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
3. When the `reset` input is active (1), the output register `q` is reset to 0.
4. If `reset` is not active, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 999. If so, `q` is reset to 0, otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.
5. The output register `q` is a 10-bit wide register, allowing it to count up to 999.'}
