module top_module(

    input p1d,
    input p1e,
    input p1f,

    input p2a, 
    input p2b, 
    input p2c,

    output reg p2y
);

    // Implement the logical AND operation on the first three inputs (p1a, p1b, and p1c)
    wire p1_and = p1a & p1b & p1c;

    // Implement the logical OR operation on the last three inputs (p1d, p1e, and p1f)
    wire p1_or = p1d | p1e | p1f;

    // Assign the output p1y as the result of the logical AND and OR operations
    always @(*) begin
        p1y = p1_and & p1_or;

    // Implement the logical AND operation on the first two inputs (p2a and p2b)

    always @(*) begin
        p2y = p2_and & p2_or;
    end

endmodule
```

The main changes are:

1. I have made the output registers `p1y` and `p2y` as `reg` instead of `wire` to ensure that the outputs are properly assigned.
2. I have used the `always @(*)` block to assign the values to the output registers `p1y` and `p2y`. This ensures that the outputs are updated based on the changes in the input signals.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the testbench output.'}
