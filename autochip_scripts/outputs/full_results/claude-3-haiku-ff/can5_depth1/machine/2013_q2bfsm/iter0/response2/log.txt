The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `resetn`: Active-low reset signal
- `x`: Input signal
- `y`: Input signal

Outputs:
- `f`: Output signal, set to 1 when the state is B
- `g`: Output signal, set to 1 when the state is G1, G2, or P1

The FSM has the following states:
- `A`: Initial state
- `B`: Transition from A to S0
- `S0`: Stays in S0 if `x` is 0, transitions to S1 if `x` is 1
- `S1`: Stays in S1 if `x` is 1, transitions to S10 if `x` is 0
- `S10`: Transitions to G1 if `x` is 1, transitions to S0 if `x` is 0
- `G1`: Transitions to P1 if `y` is 1, transitions to G2 if `y` is 0
- `G2`: Transitions to P1 if `y` is 1, transitions to P0 if `y` is 0
- `P0`: Stays in P0
- `P1`: Stays in P1

The `f` output is set to 1 when the state is B, and the `g` output is set to 1 when the state is G1, G2, or P1.

The Verilog code correctly implements the described finite state machine.'}
