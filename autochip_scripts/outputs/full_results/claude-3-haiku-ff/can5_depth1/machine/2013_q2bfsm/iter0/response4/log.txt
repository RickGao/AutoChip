The provided Verilog code implements the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

1. `A`: Initial state
2. `B`: Transition from `A`
3. `S0`: Transition from `B`
4. `S1`: Transition from `S0` when `x` is 1
5. `S10`: Transition from `S1` when `x` is 0
6. `G1`: Transition from `S10` when `x` is 1
7. `G2`: Transition from `G1` when `y` is 0
8. `P0`: Transition from `G2` when `y` is 0
9. `P1`: Transition from `G1` when `y` is 1, or from `G2` when `y` is 1

The `f` output is set to 1 when the state is `B`, and the `g` output is set to 1 when the state is `G1`, `G2`, or `P1`.

The code handles the reset condition by setting the state to `A` and initializing `f` and `g` to 0. The state transition logic is implemented using a `case` statement, and the output assignments are done within the `always` block.'}
