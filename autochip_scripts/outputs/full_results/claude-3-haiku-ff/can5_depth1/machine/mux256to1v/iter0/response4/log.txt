The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key steps are:

1. The selection vector `sel` is an 8-bit value, which is used to select a 4-bit block from the 1024-bit input vector `in`.
2. To calculate the starting index of the 4-bit block, we multiply `sel` by 4, since each block is 4 bits wide.
3. The 4-bit block is then extracted from the input vector `in` using the calculated starting index and the next 3 bits (to get a 4-bit block).
4. The extracted 4-bit block is then assigned to the output vector `out`.

This implementation correctly extracts the 4-bit block from the 1024-bit input vector based on the 8-bit selection vector and assigns it to the output.'}
