The main issues with the initial code were:

1. The bitwise operations were not correctly expressed in Verilog syntax.
2. The assignment to `q` was missing an `always` block and the `@(posedge clk)` trigger.

The corrected module uses the proper Verilog syntax for the bitwise operations and the assignment to `q` is made within an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal.'}
