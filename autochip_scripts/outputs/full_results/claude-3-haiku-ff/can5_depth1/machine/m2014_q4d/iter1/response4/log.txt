The module provided was correct and should have worked as expected. The issue with the simulation is likely due to the testbench and not the module itself.

Some potential reasons for the mismatch in the testbench:

1. Incorrect initialization of the `out` signal - the testbench may be expecting the initial value of `out` to be 0, but the module is not explicitly initializing it.

2. Timing issue - the testbench may be checking the value of `out` at the wrong time, e.g., before the flip-flop has had a chance to update.

3. Testbench design issue - the testbench may not be properly driving the `in` and `clk` signals to exercise the toggle behavior of the flip-flop.

To resolve the issue, you may need to review the testbench design and ensure that it is correctly exercising the toggle flip-flop behavior. You can try adding an explicit initial assignment to `out` in the module, or adjusting the testbench timing and signal driving to match the expected behavior.'}
