{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a simple counter that increments its output q by one every clock cycle. It has 3 inputs, a clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and an output register (q). The output register is a 4-bit register, meaning it can store values from 0 to 15.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the output register is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active, the output register is incremented by one. When the output register reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it is reset to 1. This process is repeated every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [3:0] q);'}

This Verilog module correctly implements the specified counter logic. The key points are:

1. The `output reg [3:0] q` declares the 4-bit output register `q`.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block:
   - If the `reset` signal is active, the counter is set to 1.
   - If the counter reaches 10 (binary 1010), it is reset to 1.
   - Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1.

The module correctly handles the reset signal and the counter rollover behavior as described in the problem statement.'}
