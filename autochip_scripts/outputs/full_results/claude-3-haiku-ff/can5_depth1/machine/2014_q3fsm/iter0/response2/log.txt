The provided Verilog module specification describes a state machine with 8 states: A, B, C, S10, S11, S20, S21, and S22. The module takes inputs `clk`, `reset`, `s`, and `w`, and produces an output `z`.

The logic for transitioning between states is described in the comments. For example, if the current state is A and `s` is asserted, the next state is B. If the current state is B and `w` is asserted, the next state is S11, otherwise the next state is S10.

The completed Verilog module implements this state machine logic using a case statement to determine the next state based on the current state and input signals. The `state` register keeps track of the current state, and the `next_state` variable holds the next state to transition to. The output `z` is assigned based on the current state.

The module also includes a reset functionality, where the state is reset to state A when the `reset` input is asserted.'}
