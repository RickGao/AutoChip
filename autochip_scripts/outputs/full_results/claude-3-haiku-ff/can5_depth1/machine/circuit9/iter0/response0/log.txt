The corrected Verilog module implements the given specification. The key points are:

1. The output `q` is declared as a 3-bit register `[2:0]`.
2. Inside the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`:
   - If `a` is 1, `q` is set to 4 (`3'd4`).
   - If `a` is 0:
     - If `q` is 6 (`3'd6`), `q` is set to 0 (`3'd0`).
     - If `q` is not 6, `q` is incremented by 1 (`q + 3'd1`).

The module should now correctly implement the given Mealy machine specification.'}
