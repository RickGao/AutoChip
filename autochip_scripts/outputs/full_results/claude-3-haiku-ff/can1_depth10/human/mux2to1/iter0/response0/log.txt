The provided Verilog code for a 2-to-1 multiplexer is correct. It takes two input signals `a` and `b`, along with a select signal `sel`, and outputs the appropriate value based on the select signal.

The `always @(*)` block is a combinational logic block that evaluates the output `out` based on the value of `sel`. When `sel` is 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of `a`, and when `sel` is 1, the output `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

The `default` case in the `case` statement is added to handle any undefined behavior, where the select signal `sel` might have an unexpected value. In this case, the output `out` is set to `1'bx`, which represents an unknown or high-impedance state.'}
