The provided Verilog module correctly implements the functionality to detect the positive edge transitions on each bit of an 8-bit vector. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_delay` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` signal.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in the `in_delay` register, effectively delaying it by one clock cycle.
   - The `pedge` output is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the current `in` value and the negated previous `in_delay` value. This effectively sets the output bit high only when the corresponding input bit transitions from 0 to 1.

This module should correctly detect the positive edge transitions on each bit of the 8-bit input vector and output the appropriate 8-bit result.'}
