The corrected Verilog module implements the specified Moore state machine with two states, one input, and one output. The reset state is B and reset is active-high synchronous.

The key changes made are:

1. Defined the state parameters `A` and `B` as `1'b0` and `1'b1` respectively.
2. Implemented the state transition logic in the `always @(*)` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `in`.
3. Implemented the output logic in the `always @(*)` block, which sets the output `out` based on the current state.
4. Implemented the state register in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, which updates the current state to the next state on the positive edge of the clock, and resets the state to `B` when the `reset` signal is active.'}
