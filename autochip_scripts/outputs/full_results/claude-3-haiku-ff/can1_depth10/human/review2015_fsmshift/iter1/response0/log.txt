endmodule

The main issues with the previous module were:

1. The reset was not being handled properly. The state should be reset to IDLE, the counter should be reset to 0, and the shift_ena should be set to 0.

2. The counter should be reset to 0 when transitioning from SHIFT to IDLE state, instead of keeping the value.

3. The shift_ena should be asserted only in the SHIFT state, not during the IDLE state.

With these corrections, the module should now work as expected.'}
