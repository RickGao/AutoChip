The corrected module includes the following:

1. A state machine with two states: IDLE and SHIFT.
2. A counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles the shift register should be enabled.
3. The `shift_ena` output is asserted when the state machine is in the SHIFT state.
4. The state machine transitions to the SHIFT state when the reset signal is high, and then back to the IDLE state after 4 clock cycles.
5. The `shift_ena` output is deasserted when the state machine is in the IDLE state.

This should provide the desired functionality of enabling the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the system is reset, and then keeping it disabled until the next reset.'}
