{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

The module implements a Moore state machine to model the behavior of the Lemmings game. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal
- `bump_left`: Indicates a collision on the left side
- `bump_right`: Indicates a collision on the right side
- `ground`: Indicates the presence or absence of ground

Outputs:
- `walk_left`: Indicates the Lemming is walking left
- `walk_right`: Indicates the Lemming is walking right
- `aaah`: Indicates the Lemming is falling

The state machine has two states: `LEFT` and `RIGHT`, representing the walking direction of the Lemming. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset signal `areset` sets the initial state to `LEFT`.

The combinational logic in the `always @(*)` block determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals. If the ground is absent (`ground == 0`), the state remains unchanged. If the Lemming is bumped on the left (`bump_left == 1`), the state changes to `RIGHT`, and if it's bumped on the right (`bump_right == 1`), the state changes to `LEFT`.

The output signals `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `aaah` are updated based on the current state and the ground signal. When the ground is present (`ground == 1`), the Lemming will walk in the direction of the current state. When the ground is absent (`ground == 0`), the `aaah` signal is set to 1, indicating that the Lemming is falling.'}
