The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. It uses the `clk`, `reset`, and `ena` signals to control the clock behavior:

1. The `reset` signal resets the clock to "12:00 AM" when asserted.
2. The `ena` signal is used to increment the clock, with one increment per second.
3. The `pm` signal is used to indicate whether the current time is AM or PM.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format.

The module uses nested `if` statements to handle the clock logic. When the `ena` signal is asserted, the seconds are incremented. If the seconds reach 59, the minutes are incremented, and if the minutes reach 59, the hours are incremented. The hours are handled specially to wrap around from 12 to 1 and toggle the `pm` signal accordingly.

This Verilog module should provide the required 12-hour clock functionality.'}
