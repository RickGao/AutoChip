{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

The main changes are:

1. Added `x_prev` and `x_prev2` registers to keep track of the previous two values of `x`.
2. In state `C`, the transition to state `D` is now based on the condition `x_prev2 == 1 && x_prev == 0 && x == 1`, which checks for the sequence 1-0-1 on `x`.
3. In state `D`, the output `g` is set to 1 if `y` is 1, and set to 0 if `y` is 0. This ensures the correct behavior of maintaining `g = 1` if `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, or setting `g = 0` permanently if `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles.

The module should now pass the provided testbench.'}
