This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.

The provided Verilog code represents the finite state machine (FSM) described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The state variables are declared as a 2-bit register `state` with the following state encodings:
   - `A = 2'b00`
   - `B = 2'b01`
   - `C = 2'b10`
   - `D = 2'b11`

2. The state flip-flops are implemented in an `always` block that updates the `state` variable on the positive edge of the clock. The reset logic sets the state to `A` when the `resetn` signal is low (active low).

3. The state transition logic is handled within the `case` statement in the `always` block. The transitions between the states are based on the input signals `r[1]`, `r[2]`, and `r[3]`, as described in the problem statement.

4. The output logic is implemented using continuous assignment statements, where the `g[i]` signals are assigned the value of `1` when the FSM is in the corresponding state (`B`, `C`, or `D`).

This Verilog code should correctly implement the described FSM and the arbiter circuit.'}
