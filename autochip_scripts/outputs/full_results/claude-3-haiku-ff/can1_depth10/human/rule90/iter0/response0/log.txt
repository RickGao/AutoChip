{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 90 cellular automaton as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module `top_module` takes the following inputs:
   - `clk`: Clock signal
   - `load`: Indicates whether the state of the system should be loaded with `data[511:0]`
   - `data[511:0]`: Initial state of the 512-cell system

2. The module has one output, `q[511:0]`, which represents the current state of the 512-cell system.

3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).

4. If the `load` signal is high, the current state `q` is updated with the `data[511:0]` input.

5. If the `load` signal is low, the next state of the system is calculated as follows:
   - The first cell `q[0]` is set to the value of the second cell `q[1]`.
   - The last cell `q[511]` is set to 0 (the boundary condition).
   - For all other cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is calculated as the XOR of the current cell and its two neighbors.

This implementation correctly updates the state of the 512-cell system according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton.'}
