system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // 
the top module has a input in, a 10 bit input state, 10bit output next_state, 2 output out1 and out2.

out1 is equal to state[8] or state[9], out2 is equal to state[7] or state[9]
next_state[0] is equal to not(in) and (the or of state[4:0], state[7], state[8], state[9])
next_state[1] is equal to in and the or of state[0], state[8] and state[9]
next_state[2] is equal to in and state[1]
next_state[3] is equal to in and state[2]
next_state[4] is equal to in and state[3]
next_state[5] is equal to in and state[4]
next_state[6] is equal to in and state[5]
next_state[7] is equal to in and the or of state[6] and state[7]
next_state[8] is equal to not(in) and state[5]
