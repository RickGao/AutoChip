The issue with the provided Verilog module was that the initial value of the output signal `out` was not set. This led to incorrect behavior during the simulation.

To fix this, you can initialize the `out` signal to 0 in the module, as shown below:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input in,
    output logic out
);

initial begin
    out = 1'b0;
end

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= out ^ in;
end

endmodule
```

This should resolve the issue and pass the provided testbench.'}
