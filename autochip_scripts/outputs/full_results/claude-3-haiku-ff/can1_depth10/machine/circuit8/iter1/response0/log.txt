end

always @(posedge clock) begin
    p <= a;

endmodule

The issues with the original module were:

1. The second always block was triggered on any change of the input signal `a`, instead of on the positive edge of the clock signal. This means that the register `p` would be updated every time `a` changed, even if the clock was not high. This was causing the mismatch in the output `p` observed in the testbench.

2. The second always block was incorrectly assigning the value of `a` to `p` if the clock signal was high. This should be done unconditionally, without checking the clock signal.

The corrected module assigns the value of `a` to `q` on the negative edge of the clock, and assigns the value of `a` to `p` on the positive edge of the clock, which matches the intended behavior described in the problem statement.'}
