module top_module(

    input p1f,

        p2y = (p2a & p2b) | (p2c | p2d);
    end

endmodule

The main issues with the original module were:

1. The outputs `p1y` and `p2y` were declared as combinational logic, but the module did not have any continuous assignment statements to drive them. This caused the outputs to have unknown/high-impedance values.

2. The logic expressions for `p1y` and `p2y` were not correctly implemented. The original module had a mix of `&` and `|` operations, which is not the same as the specified logic.

In the corrected module, I have:

1. Declared `p1y` and `p2y` as `reg` outputs and used an `always` block to assign them based on the specified logic expressions.

2. Implemented the correct logic expressions for `p1y` and `p2y` using the appropriate `&` and `|` operations.

This should fix the issues observed in the testbench simulation.'}
