endmodule

The issues in the original module were:
1. The input `y` was declared as `[6:1]` but the bits used for `Y4` calculation were `y[2], y[3], y[5], y[6]`. This has been corrected to use `y[1], y[2], y[4], y[5]`.
2. The first bit of `y` was used for `Y2` calculation, but Verilog array indexing starts from 0, so `y[1]` has been corrected to `y[0]`.

With these corrections, the module should now pass the testbench.'}
