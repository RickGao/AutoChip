The provided Verilog module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The final output `q` is the logical OR of the two flip-flop outputs, effectively creating a dual-edge triggered behavior.

This solution overcomes the limitation that FPGAs don't have direct support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops, by using the standard positive and negative edge-triggered flip-flops available on the FPGA.'}
