The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Declared `shift_ena` as a `reg` output instead of a simple output, since it needs to be assigned a value inside the module.
2. Introduced a 2-bit counter `count` to keep track of the number of clock cycles the `shift_ena` signal needs to be asserted.
3. In the `always` block:
   - If `reset` is asserted, reset the `count` to 0 and assert `shift_ena` for 1 clock cycle.
   - If `count` is less than 3 (i.e., the first 4 clock cycles after reset), increment `count` and keep `shift_ena` asserted.
   - If `count` is 3 or more, deassert `shift_ena`.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles after a reset, and then kept deasserted until the next reset.'}
