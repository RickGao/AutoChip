The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `q` of 4-bit width to represent the decade counter.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. Inside the `always` block, the module first checks if the `reset` input is high. If it is, the counter `q` is set to 0.
4. If the `reset` input is not high, the module checks if the current value of `q` is 9 (the maximum value in the decade counter). If it is, the counter is reset to 0.
5. If the current value of `q` is not 9, the counter is incremented by 1.

This completes the implementation of the decade counter as per the given specification.'}
