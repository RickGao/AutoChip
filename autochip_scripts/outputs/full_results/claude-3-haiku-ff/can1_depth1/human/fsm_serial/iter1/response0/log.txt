{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

```

The main issues with the original code were:

1. The `done` output was not being properly reset to 0 when the state machine was in the `IDLE` state.
2. The state machine was not handling the case where the stop bit was not detected correctly. It should transition to the `WAIT_STOP` state and wait until a stop bit is detected before attempting to receive the next byte.

With these corrections, the module should now pass the testbench simulations correctly.'}
