The main issues were:
1. The reset signal was not properly handling the state transition. The reset should set the state to S0 on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The start_shifting output was not being set correctly in all states. It should be set to 1 in the S4 state and 0 in all other states.

These changes should fix the issues and pass the testbench.'}
