The corrected Verilog module includes the following changes:

1. The addition of the two 8-bit numbers is performed using the `$signed()` function to handle 2's complement signed arithmetic.
2. The 8-bit sum is assigned to the output `s`.
3. The overflow detection logic checks if the signs of the two inputs are the same, but the sign of the output is different, indicating a signed overflow has occurred.

This module should now correctly add two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detect signed overflow.'}
