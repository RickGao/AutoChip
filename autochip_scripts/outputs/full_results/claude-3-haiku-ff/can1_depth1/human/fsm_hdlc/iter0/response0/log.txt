{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

The provided Verilog code implements a Moore-type finite state machine that recognizes the three sequences as specified in the problem statement:

1. 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
2. 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
3. 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

The finite state machine has four states: IDLE, DISC, FLAG, and ERR. The state transitions and output signal generation are handled in the `always` block, which updates the state and the output signals based on the current state and the input `in`.

The `count` variable is used to keep track of the number of consecutive 1s, and the appropriate output signal is asserted when the corresponding sequence is detected.

The module also handles the reset signal, which sets the state to IDLE and resets the output signals and the `count` variable.'}
