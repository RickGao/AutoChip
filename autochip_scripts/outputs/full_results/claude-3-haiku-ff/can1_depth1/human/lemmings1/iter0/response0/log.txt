{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. Implement a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine for the Lemmings game. It has the following features:

1. The module has two states: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`.
2. The current state is stored in the `state` register.
3. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal or the `areset` signal.
4. When `areset` is high, the state is set to `WALK_LEFT`, and the `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are set accordingly.
5. In the `WALK_LEFT` state, if `bump_right` is high, the state transitions to `WALK_RIGHT`.
6. In the `WALK_RIGHT` state, if `bump_left` is high, the state transitions to `WALK_LEFT`.
7. The `walk_left` and `walk_right` outputs are updated based on the current state.

This Verilog module correctly models the behavior of the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement.'}
