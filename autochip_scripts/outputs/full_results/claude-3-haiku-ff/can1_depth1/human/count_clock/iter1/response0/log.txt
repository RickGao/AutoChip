The main issues with the original code were:

1. The hours value was not wrapping around from 12 to 1 correctly. This has been fixed.
2. The BCD representation for the hours, minutes, and seconds was not correct. The code now uses the proper BCD format for these values.

These changes should resolve the issues reported in the test bench output.'}
