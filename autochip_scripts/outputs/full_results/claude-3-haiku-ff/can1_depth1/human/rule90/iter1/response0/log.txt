{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off).

{'assistant': 'Apologies for the issue. Here's the corrected module:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end
    else begin
        // Create a temporary array to store the next state
        reg [511:0] next_q;

        // Compute the next state of each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
            next_q[i] = (i == 0) ? q[1] : (i == 511) ? q[510] : q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
        end

        // Update the current state
        q <= next_q;
    end
end

endmodule
```

The main changes are:

1. In the `for` loop, the boundary conditions for the first and last cells were not handled correctly. I've fixed this by using the appropriate index values for the neighboring cells.
2. The XOR operation was performed correctly, but the order of the operands was incorrect. I've updated the expression to use the correct order.

With these changes, the module should now work as expected and pass the testbench.'}
