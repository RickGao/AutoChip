The original Verilog module specification was incomplete, as it did not include the implementation of the `full_adder` module. I have added the necessary `full_adder` module to complete the implementation of the 4-bit adder.

The `full_adder` module implements the logic for a single full adder, which takes two 1-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and a 1-bit carry-in `cin`, and produces a 1-bit sum `s` and a 1-bit carry-out `cout`.

The `top_module` instantiates four `full_adder` modules, one for each bit position of the 4-bit inputs `x` and `y`. The carry-out from each full adder is fed into the carry-in of the next full adder, and the final carry-out is assigned to the most significant bit of the 5-bit output `sum`.'}
