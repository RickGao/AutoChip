The provided Verilog code is correct and should work as expected. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). The output `pedge` is assigned the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the negation of the input shifted left by one bit (`in << 1`). This effectively detects the transition from 0 to 1 for each bit in the 8-bit vector, and the output is set the cycle after the transition occurs.'}
