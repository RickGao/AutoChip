The completed Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input. The machine accepts input numbers of arbitrary length and the conversion begins when `Reset` is released and stops when `Reset` is asserted.

The module has three main states:
1. `IDLE`: The initial state where the output `z` is set to 0 and the `bit_count` is reset to 0.
2. `COMPUTE`: In this state, the input `x` is shifted into the `accumulator` register, and the `bit_count` is incremented. When the `bit_count` reaches 7 (indicating the end of the input), the next state is set to `DONE` and the 2's complement of the `accumulator` is stored in `z`.
3. `DONE`: In this state, the 2's complement of the `accumulator` is continuously output in `z`.

The `next_state` logic is defined in the second `always` block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x` and `areset`.'}
