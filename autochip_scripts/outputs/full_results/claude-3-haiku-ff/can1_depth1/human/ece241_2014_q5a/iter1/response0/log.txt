```

The main changes are:

1. Changed the bit_count to count up to 8 instead of 7, as the specification requires the conversion to be done for numbers of arbitrary length.
2. Added a transition from the COMPUTE state back to itself when the bit_count is less than 8, to continue the computation.
3. Moved the assignment of z in the DONE state to always assign the 2's complement of the accumulator.

These changes should resolve the issues with the previous implementation and pass the provided testbench.'}
