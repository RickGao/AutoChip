The provided Verilog code implements the Moore machine described in the problem statement. The key points are:

1. The states are defined as A (0) and B (1) using the `localparam` construct.
2. The `state` register stores the current state, and the `next_state` register stores the next state.
3. The `always` block with `posedge clk or posedge areset` updates the `state` register based on the asynchronous reset (`areset`) or the next state (`next_state`).
4. The `always` block with `(*)` defines the next state and output logic based on the current state and the input `in`.
5. The output `out` is set to 0 in state A and 1 in state B.
6. The default case ensures that the machine transitions to state B if an undefined state is reached.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the described Moore machine.'}
