{'role': 'user', 'content': '// We want to create a timer that:\n// (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n// In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The provided Verilog module implementation has the following key points:

1. The module has a synchronous reset that sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state.
2. In the `IDLE` state, the module monitors the `data` input and shifts the bits into the `pattern` register. When the pattern `1101` is detected, the state machine transitions to the `DETECT_PATTERN` state.
3. In the `DETECT_PATTERN` state, the `shift_ena` output is asserted, and the state machine transitions to the `SHIFT_DURATION` state.
4. In the `SHIFT_DURATION` state, the `shift_ena` output is deasserted after 4 clock cycles, and the `counting` output is asserted, transitioning the state machine to the `WAIT_COUNTING` state.
5. In the `WAIT_COUNTING` state, the module waits for the `done_counting` input to be asserted, indicating that the counting operation has completed. When `done_counting` is asserted, the `counting` output is deasserted, and the state machine transitions to the `NOTIFY_TIMEOUT` state.
6. In the `NOTIFY_TIMEOUT` state, the `done` output is asserted to notify the user that the timer has timed out, and the state machine transitions to the `WAIT_ACK` state.
7. In the `WAIT_ACK` state, the module waits for the `ack` input to be asserted, indicating that the user has acknowledged the timer timeout. When `ack` is asserted, the `done` output is deasserted, and the state machine transitions back to the `IDLE` state.

The provided implementation should correctly implement the specified finite-state machine behavior for the timer control logic.'}
