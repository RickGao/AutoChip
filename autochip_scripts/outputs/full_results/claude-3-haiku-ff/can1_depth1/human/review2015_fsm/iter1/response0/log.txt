The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin.

After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

The main issues with the original module were:

1. The `shift_ena` signal was not being deasserted correctly after 4 clock cycles.
2. The `counting` signal was not being deasserted correctly after the `done_counting` signal was received.
3. The `done` signal was not being deasserted correctly after the `ack` signal was received.

The corrected module addresses these issues by modifying the state transitions and signal assignments accordingly.'}
