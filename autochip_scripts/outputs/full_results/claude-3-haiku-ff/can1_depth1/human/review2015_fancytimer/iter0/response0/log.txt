{'role': 'user', 'content': "// We want to create a timer with one input that:\n\n// (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input until it resumes searching after everything else is done.\n\n// The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. \n\n// When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).\n\n// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous. \n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput wire clk,\n\tinput wire reset,\n\tinput wire data,\n    output wire [3:0] count,\n    output reg counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input wire ack );"}

```

The provided Verilog module implements the desired timer functionality as per the given specification. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. The module has the following ports:
   - `clk`: Clock input
   - `reset`: Synchronous reset input
   - `data`: Serial data input
   - `count`: Output for the current remaining time
   - `counting`: Output to indicate when the timer is counting
   - `done`: Output to notify the user when the timer has timed out
   - `ack`: Input to acknowledge the timer timeout

2. The module uses a 2-bit `state` register to track the current state of the state machine:
   - `WAIT_START`: Waiting for the 1101 start pattern
   - `CAPTURE_DELAY`: Capturing the 4-bit delay value
   - `COUNT_DOWN`: Counting down the timer
   - `WAIT_ACK`: Waiting for the user to acknowledge the timer timeout

3. The `delay` register stores the 4-bit delay value, and the `counter` register is used to track the countdown.

4. The state machine logic handles the following:
   - In the `WAIT_START` state, it shifts in the incoming data to detect the 1101 start pattern.
   - When the start pattern is detected, it transitions to the `CAPTURE_DELAY` state to read the 4-bit delay value.
   - In the `CAPTURE_DELAY` state, it reads the delay value and starts the countdown.
   - In the `COUNT_DOWN` state, it decrements the counter and asserts the `counting` and `done` outputs when the countdown is complete.
   - In the `WAIT_ACK` state, it waits for the user to acknowledge the timer timeout by setting the `ack` input to 1.

5. The `count` output is calculated based on the current state and the remaining time in the countdown.

The provided Verilog module should correctly implement the desired timer functionality according to the given specification.'}
