This Verilog code implements the finite state machine circuit described in the problem. The module has three D flip-flops (q1, q2, q3) that are connected to the input `x` through a XOR, AND, and OR gate, respectively. The outputs of the flip-flops are then fed into a three-input XNOR gate, whose output is `z`.

The XOR gate has `x` as one input and the corresponding flip-flop output `q1` as the other input. The AND gate has `x` as one input and the complemented output of the corresponding flip-flop `~q2` as the other input. The OR gate has `x` as one input and the complemented output of the corresponding flip-flop `~q3` as the other input.

The D flip-flops are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The final output `z` is the result of the three-input XNOR operation on the flip-flop outputs `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`.'}
