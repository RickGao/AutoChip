The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed module is as shown above. The key points are:

1. The output `mux_in` is declared as a 4-bit wide `reg` type.
2. The module uses a continuous assignment (`always @(*)`) to compute the four bits of `mux_in` based on the input signals `c` and `d`.
   - `mux_in[0]` is assigned the logical OR of `c` and `d`.
   - `mux_in[1]` is assigned the constant value `1'b0`.
   - `mux_in[2]` is assigned the logical NOT of `d`.
   - `mux_in[3]` is assigned the logical AND of `c` and `d`.'}
