module top_module(

endmodule

The issue with the previous module was in the else block. It was using the XOR operation (`^`) to shift the bits, which is incorrect. Instead, the correct way to shift the bits is to use the concatenation operator (`{}`). This will shift the bits to the right by one position and add a 0 at the end.

The corrected module should now work correctly and pass the test bench.'}
