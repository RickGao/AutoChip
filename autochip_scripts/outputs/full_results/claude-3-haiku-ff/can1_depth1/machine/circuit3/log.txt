system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module implements a logic gate that takes four inputs (a, b, c, and d) and outputs a single bit (q). The logic gate is a bitwise OR of the inputs a and b, and a bitwise OR of the inputs c and d. The output q is a bitwise AND of the two ORs. This means that the output q will be 1 only if at least one of the inputs a and b is 1, and at least one of the inputs c and d is 1.
