system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This module is a sequential circuit with two outputs, q and state. The inputs are clock, a, and b. The clock is used to synchronize the circuit, and the inputs a and b are used to control the circuit's behavior.  The circuit is composed of two main components: a register and an assignment. The register is used to store the value of c, which is calculated from the inputs a and b. The register is clocked by the input clock signal, so that the value of c is updated on each rising edge of the clock. The value of c is calculated as the logical OR of the logical AND of a and b, the logical AND of a and c, and the logical AND of b and c.  The assignment is used to calculate the outputs q and state. The output q is calculated as the logical XOR of a, b, and c. The output state is simply the value of c.
