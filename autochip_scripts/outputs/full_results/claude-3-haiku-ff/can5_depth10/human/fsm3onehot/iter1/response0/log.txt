The main issue with the previous implementation was that the next state logic was not handling all possible cases. The corrected module ensures that the next state is correctly computed for all possible input and state combinations.

The key changes are:

1. Added a `default` case to handle any unexpected state values.
2. Simplified the next state logic by directly assigning the next state based on the current state and input value.

With these changes, the module should now work correctly with both one-hot and random inputs.'}
