{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid.

This Verilog module implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `load` to load the initial state, an input `data` for the initial state, and an output `q` for the current state of the game.

The `always @(*)` block computes the next state of the game based on the current state and the rules of the Game of Life. It loops through each cell in the grid, counts the number of live neighbors for the current cell, and updates the next state of the cell based on the rules.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the current state of the game. If the `load` input is high, the current state is set to the input `data`. Otherwise, the current state is updated to the next state computed in the previous block.'}
