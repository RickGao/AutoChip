{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).

The provided Verilog module implements the cellular automaton known as the "Game of Life" on a 16x16 toroidal grid. Here's how the module works:

1. The `load` input is used to load the initial state of the game into the `q` register at the next clock edge.
2. On each clock cycle, the `next_state` is calculated based on the current state `q` and the rules of the Game of Life.
3. The `next_state` is then assigned to the `q` register, effectively updating the game state for the next clock cycle.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The use of a nested loop to iterate over all 256 cells in the 16x16 grid.
2. The calculation of the number of neighbors for each cell, taking into account the toroidal nature of the grid.
3. The application of the Game of Life rules to determine the next state of each cell.
4. The assignment of the `next_state` to the `q` register, either updating the state or maintaining the current state based on the load signal.

This Verilog module correctly implements the Game of Life cellular automaton on a 16x16 toroidal grid.'}
