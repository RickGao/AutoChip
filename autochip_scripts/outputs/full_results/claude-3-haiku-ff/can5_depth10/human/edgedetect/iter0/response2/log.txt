The corrected Verilog module detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector `in` and sets the corresponding bit in the output `pedge` during the next clock cycle.

The key changes are:

1. Added a register `in_prev` to store the previous input value.
2. In the `always` block, first updated the `in_prev` register with the current input value.
3. Then, the output `pedge` is assigned the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the negation of the previous input `~in_prev`. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit.'}
