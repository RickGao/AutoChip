The provided Verilog module is correct and should work as expected. The key points are:

1. The `in_prev` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` input.
2. In the `always` block, the current value of `in` is stored in `in_prev` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. The `pedge` output is then calculated by performing a bitwise AND between the current `in` value and the negated previous `in_prev` value. This ensures that the output bit is set only when the corresponding input bit changes from 0 to 1.'}
