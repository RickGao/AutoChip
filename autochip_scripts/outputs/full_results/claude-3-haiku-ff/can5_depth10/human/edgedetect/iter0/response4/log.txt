The provided Verilog module correctly implements the functionality you described. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_reg` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` input.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal:
   - The current value of `in` is stored in the `in_reg` register.
   - The `pedge` output is calculated as the logical AND of the current value of `in` and the negation of the previous value stored in `in_reg`. This effectively detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector.

This module should correctly detect the 0 to 1 transitions for each bit in the 8-bit input vector and set the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output one clock cycle after the transition occurs.'}
