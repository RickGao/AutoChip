The logic for the next-state signals Y2 and Y4 is derived as follows:

Y2 (corresponding to y[2], which represents state B and C):
- From the state diagram, the next state is B when the current state is A and the input is 0, or the current state is C and the input is 0.
- Therefore, the logic expression for Y2 is: (y[1] & ~w) | (y[3] & ~w)

Y4 (corresponding to y[4], which represents state D and E):
- From the state diagram, the next state is D when the current state is B and the input is 1, the current state is C and the input is 1, or the current state is D and the input is 0.
- The next state is also D when the current state is E and the input is 1.
- Therefore, the logic expression for Y4 is: (y[2] & w) | (y[3] & w) | (y[6] & ~w)

The Verilog code implements these logic expressions for the next-state signals Y2 and Y4.'}
