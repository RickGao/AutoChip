The Verilog module you provided is correct and should work as expected. It implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence "1101" in the input data stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and keeps it at 1 until the `reset` signal is asserted.

The module has two states: `SEARCH` and `FOUND`. In the `SEARCH` state, it continuously shifts the input data into a 4-bit shift register and checks if the contents of the shift register match the sequence "1101". If a match is found, it transitions to the `FOUND` state. In the `FOUND` state, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and remains in this state until `reset` is asserted.

The module handles the reset signal correctly, transitioning to the `SEARCH` state when `reset` is asserted, regardless of the current state.'}
