The provided Verilog module implements a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1 and keeps it at 1 until the `reset` input is asserted.

The module uses four states: `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, and `S3`, where `S0` corresponds to the initial state and `S3` corresponds to the state where the 1101 sequence has been detected. The `next_state` logic updates the state based on the current state and the input `data`.

When the module is in the `S3` state, it sets the `start_shifting` output to 1, indicating that the 1101 sequence has been found. The `start_shifting` output remains at 1 until the `reset` input is asserted, at which point the state machine returns to the initial `S0` state.'}
