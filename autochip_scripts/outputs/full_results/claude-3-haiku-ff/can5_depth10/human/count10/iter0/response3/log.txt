The provided Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high synchronous and resets the counter to 0.

The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is set to 0 (`q <= 4'b0`). Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 1'b1`) until it reaches the maximum value of 9 (4'd9), at which point it is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'b0`).'}
