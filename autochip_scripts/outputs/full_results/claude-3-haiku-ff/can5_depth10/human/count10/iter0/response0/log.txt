The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module `top_module` has two inputs: `clk` (the clock signal) and `reset` (the active high synchronous reset signal), and one output: `q` (the 4-bit decade counter).

2. The always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`).

3. Inside the always block, the first `if` statement checks if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, the counter `q` is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'd0`).

4. If the `reset` signal is not high, the module checks the current value of the counter `q`. If `q` is equal to 9 (`q == 4'd9`), the counter is reset to 0 (`q <= 4'd0`). Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 (`q <= q + 4'd1`).

This Verilog module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a period of 10, and resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.'}
