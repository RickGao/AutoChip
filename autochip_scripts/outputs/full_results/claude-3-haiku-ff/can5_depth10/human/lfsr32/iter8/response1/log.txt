{'assistant': 'I apologize for the confusion earlier. Based on the error message, it seems that the taps for the 32-bit Galois LFSR should be at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. Here is the corrected module:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [31:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 32'h1;
    end
    else begin
        q <= {q[30:0], q[31] ^ q[22] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]};
    end
end

endmodule
```

The key changes are:
1. The taps are at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1, as specified in the problem statement.
2. The XOR operation is performed on the appropriate bit positions to produce the next state of the LFSR.

This should resolve the issues and pass the testbench.'}
