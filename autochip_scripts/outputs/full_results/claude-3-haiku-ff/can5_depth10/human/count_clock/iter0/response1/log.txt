The provided Verilog module implements a 12-hour clock with am/pm indicator. The module has the following features:

1. The clock is clocked by the `clk` input and incremented on the `ena` input pulse.
2. The `reset` input is a synchronous reset that sets the clock to "12:00 AM".
3. The `pm` output is asserted when the clock is in the PM period, and deasserted for AM.
4. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs represent the hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) in BCD format.
5. The module handles the rollover of seconds, minutes, and hours correctly, including the transition between AM and PM.

The module should work as specified in the given problem statement.'}
