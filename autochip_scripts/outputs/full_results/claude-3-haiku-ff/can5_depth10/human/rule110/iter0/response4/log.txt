{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton as described. The key points are:

1. The `q` register stores the current state of the 512-cell array.
2. On a `load` signal, the `q` register is loaded with the provided `data`.
3. On a clock cycle without `load`, the next state of each cell is computed based on the Rule 110 table:
   - The first and last cells (`q[0]` and `q[511]`) are handled separately, assuming the boundary conditions are both 0.
   - For the internal cells (`q[1]` to `q[510]`), the next state is computed based on the current cell and its two neighbors using the Rule 110 logic.

This implementation advances the cellular automaton by one time step on each clock cycle, as requested.'}
