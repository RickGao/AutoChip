{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The key points are:

1. The module has a 512-bit output `q` that represents the state of the 512-cell system.
2. On the posedge of the clock, if the `load` input is high, the state is loaded from the `data` input.
3. If the `load` input is low, the state is updated according to the Rule 110 cellular automaton:
   - The bits in `q` are shifted one position to the right, except for the rightmost bit.
   - The new rightmost bit is computed based on the rule table provided in the problem statement.

The boundary conditions (q[-1] and q[512]) are assumed to be 0 (off) as per the problem statement.'}
