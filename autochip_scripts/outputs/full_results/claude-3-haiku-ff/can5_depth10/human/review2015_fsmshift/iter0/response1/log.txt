The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Added a `reg` declaration for the `shift_ena` output.
2. Defined the state machine with the `IDLE`, `SHIFT`, and `DONE` states.
3. Implemented the state machine logic in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, with the appropriate state transitions and counter updates.
4. Asserted `shift_ena` only when the state machine is in the `SHIFT` state.
5. Handled the reset condition by transitioning to the `SHIFT` state and setting `shift_ena` to `1'b1` for 4 clock cycles.

This module will now correctly enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and will assert `shift_ena` for 4 cycles upon reset, then keep it at `0` until the next reset.'}
