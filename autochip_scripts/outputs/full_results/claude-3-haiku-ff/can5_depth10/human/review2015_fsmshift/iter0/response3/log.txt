The module has been corrected as follows:

1. Added a register `state` to keep track of the current state of the FSM.
2. Initialized the `state` register to `RESET` upon reset.
3. Asserted `shift_ena` to 1'b1 in the `RESET` state and maintained it for 4 clock cycles.
4. Transitioned to the `SHIFT` state after 4 clock cycles in the `RESET` state.
5. Maintained `shift_ena` as 1'b1 in the `SHIFT` state for one clock cycle.
6. Transitioned to the `IDLE` state after one clock cycle in the `SHIFT` state.
7. Set `shift_ena` to 1'b0 in the `IDLE` state.
8. Added a default case to handle any unknown states.

This implementation ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the FSM is reset, and then remains de-asserted until the next reset.'}
