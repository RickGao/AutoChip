The provided Verilog module is correct and should compile without any issues. It implements the desired functionality of enabling the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the proper bit pattern is detected, and then keeping the shift_ena signal low until the next reset.

The module uses a two-bit state machine to track the current state of the FSM. The IDLE state is the initial state, where the shift_ena signal is asserted for 4 clock cycles. The DONE state is reached after 4 clock cycles, and the shift_ena signal is then kept low until the next reset.

The module also uses a 2-bit counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles since the reset signal was asserted.'}
