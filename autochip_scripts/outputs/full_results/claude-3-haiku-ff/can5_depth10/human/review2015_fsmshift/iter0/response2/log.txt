The module you provided has the following issues:

1. The `shift_ena` signal is not initialized properly. It should be declared as a `reg` type and initialized to `0` in the reset condition.
2. The counter logic is not correct. The counter should be incremented only when the `shift_ena` is high, and it should be reset to `0` when the count reaches `3` (2'b11).

The corrected module addresses these issues and provides the desired functionality.

The key changes are:

1. Declared `shift_ena` as a `reg` type.
2. Initialized `shift_ena` to `1'b1` in the reset condition, and set it to `1'b0` when the count reaches `2'b11`.
3. Incremented the counter only when `shift_ena` is `1'b1`, and reset the counter to `2'b00` when it reaches `2'b11`.

This ensures that the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the module is reset, and then remains `0` until the next reset.'}
