To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences as described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
3. `01111111...`: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

The module has three output signals: `disc`, `flag`, and `err`, which are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the corresponding condition occurs.

The state transition logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, and the output logic is implemented in the `always @(posedge clk)` block.

The module also handles the reset signal, which sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state and resets the output signals.'}
