Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

This Verilog module implements the synchronous HDLC framing state machine as described in the problem statement. The state machine has four states: `IDLE`, `DISC`, `FLAG`, and `ERR`. The next state logic handles the transitions between these states based on the current state and the input `in`.

The output logic sets the appropriate output signals (`disc`, `flag`, and `err`) based on the current state of the state machine. The outputs are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.

The module also includes a synchronous reset signal `reset` that sets the state machine to the `IDLE` state, behaving as though the previous input was 0.'}
