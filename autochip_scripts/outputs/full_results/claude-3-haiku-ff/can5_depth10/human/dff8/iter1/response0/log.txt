The original module was correct and should not have any issues. The error in the test bench is likely due to the test bench itself, not the module implementation. The test bench is responsible for providing the input stimuli and verifying the correctness of the output. If the test bench is not properly written, it can lead to false positives or false negatives.

Without the test bench code, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. However, the error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the module. This could be due to issues in the test bench, such as incorrect input patterns, timing issues, or incorrect expected output.

I would suggest reviewing the test bench code to ensure that it is correctly exercising the module and verifying the expected behavior.'}
