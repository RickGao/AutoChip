The provided Verilog module specification can be implemented using two separate flip-flops triggered on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively, and then combining their outputs to achieve the effect of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

The module has the following components:

1. `q_pos`: A register that captures the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. `q_neg`: A register that captures the input `d` on the negative edge of the clock.
3. A combinational logic block that assigns the output `q` to the logical OR of `q_pos` and `q_neg`, effectively creating the dual-edge triggered behavior.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while still being compatible with FPGA architectures that do not support direct dual-edge triggered flip-flops.'}
