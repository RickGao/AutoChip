The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of a registered input `d_reg` and the XOR operation between the clock signal `clk` and the registered input `d_reg`.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. The `d_reg` register stores the previous value of the input `d`.
2. The `q` output is assigned the result of the XOR operation between the current clock signal `clk` and the previous input value `d_reg`.
   - This effectively triggers the output `q` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal.

This approach allows the circuit to behave like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, even though FPGAs do not have native support for such a construct. The sensitivity list `@(posedge clk)` is a legal and supported construct in Verilog.'}
