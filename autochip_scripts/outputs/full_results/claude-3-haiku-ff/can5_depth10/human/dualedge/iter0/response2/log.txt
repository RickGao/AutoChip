The provided Verilog code implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the other on the negative edge. The final output `q` is a combination of the two outputs `q_pos` and `q_neg`, effectively creating a flip-flop that is triggered on both edges of the clock.

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. Two separate flip-flops, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, are used to capture the input `d` on the positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively.
2. The `always @(posedge clk)` and `always @(negedge clk)` blocks are used to update the respective flip-flop outputs.
3. The final output `q` is assigned the logical OR of `q_pos` and `q_neg` in the `always @(*)` block, which combines the two flip-flop outputs to mimic the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

This implementation allows you to achieve the desired functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop on FPGAs, which do not directly support the `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` sensitivity list.'}
