The main issue with the previous implementation was that it was using separate registers `q_pos` and `q_neg` to capture the data on the positive and negative edges of the clock, and then combining them using a combinational logic. This approach is not correct as it does not accurately capture the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

In the corrected module, we use a single `always` block that is sensitive to both the positive and negative edges of the clock. Inside the block, we use an `if` statement to check the clock edge and update the `q` register accordingly. This ensures that the output `q` is updated on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, effectively emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.'}
