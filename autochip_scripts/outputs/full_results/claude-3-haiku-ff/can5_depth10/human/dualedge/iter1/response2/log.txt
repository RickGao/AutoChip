module top_module(

reg q_pos, q_neg;

end

endmodule

The issues with the previous version were:
1. The final `always` block was not using the correct sensitivity list. It should be `posedge clk or negedge clk` to capture both positive and negative edges of the clock.
2. The logic in the final `always` block was incorrect. It should assign `q` based on the values of `q_pos` and `q_neg` on the respective clock edges.

This corrected version should pass the provided testbench.'}
