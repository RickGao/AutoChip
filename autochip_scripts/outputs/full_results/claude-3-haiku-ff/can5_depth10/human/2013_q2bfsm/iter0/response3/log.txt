{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has four states:

1. `STATE_A`: The initial state where the FSM stays when the reset signal is asserted. In this state, the outputs `f` and `g` are set to 0.
2. `STATE_B`: When the reset signal is de-asserted, the FSM moves to this state and sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
3. `STATE_C`: The FSM monitors the input `x` in this state, looking for the sequence 1, 0, 1. When this sequence is detected, the FSM moves to `STATE_D`.
4. `STATE_D`: In this state, the output `g` is set to 1. The FSM then monitors the input `y`. If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently.

The module uses a `reg` variable `state` to keep track of the current state of the FSM. The `always` block handles the state transitions and updates the outputs `f` and `g` accordingly.'}
