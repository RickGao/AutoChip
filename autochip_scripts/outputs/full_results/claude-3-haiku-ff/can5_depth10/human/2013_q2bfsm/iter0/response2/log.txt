{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. The module has the required inputs and outputs, and the state machine logic is implemented using a combination of combinational and sequential logic.

The module has four states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`. The state transitions and output logic are as follows:

1. `STATE_A`: This is the initial state when the reset signal is asserted. In this state, the outputs `f` and `g` are set to 0, and the `x_count` is reset to 0.
2. `STATE_B`: When the reset signal is de-asserted, the FSM transitions to this state. In this state, the output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle, and the `x_count` is incremented if `x` is 1.
3. `STATE_C`: When the `x_count` reaches 3 (indicating that `x` has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles), the FSM transitions to this state. In this state, the output `g` is set to 1 if `y` is 1, and maintained at 1 until the reset signal is asserted.
4. `STATE_D`: If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles while in `STATE_C`, the FSM transitions to this state, and the output `g` is maintained at 1 until the reset signal is asserted.

The next state logic is implemented in the `always @(*)` block, and the state transitions and output logic are implemented in the `always @(posedge clk, negedge resetn)` block.'}
