{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

Explanation:

1. The module has four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. In state A, the module stays in reset mode, with f and g both set to 0.
3. When the reset is de-asserted, the module moves to state B, where it sets f to 1 for one clock cycle.
4. In state C, the module checks if x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles. If so, it moves to state D.
5. In state D, the module monitors the y input. If y becomes 1 within two clock cycles, it sets g to 1 permanently. If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, it sets g to 0 permanently.
6. The module uses a case statement to handle the state transitions and update the output signals f and g.'}
