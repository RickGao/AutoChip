{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as per the provided specification. It has the following key features:

1. Defines the states of the FSM using localparam constants.
2. Maintains the current state in a register.
3. Stores the history of the `x` input in a 2-bit register.
4. Tracks the number of clock cycles since `y` was 1 in a 2-bit register.
5. Handles the reset signal and transitions between the states as per the specification.
6. Sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle when the reset signal is de-asserted.
7. Sets the output `g` to 1 when the `x` input has the sequence 1, 0, 1, and maintains `g = 1` or sets `g = 0` permanently based on the `y` input.

This module should now compile and function correctly according to the given specification.'}
