{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog code implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. It has the following features:

1. Defines the states of the FSM using `localparam` for the state encoding.
2. Implements the state transition logic using a `always` block that updates the current state based on the `resetn` signal.
3. Implements the next state logic using a `always` block that determines the next state based on the current state and the input signals `x` and `y`.
4. Implements the output logic using an `always` block that sets the output signals `f` and `g` based on the current state.

The FSM operates as follows:

1. When `resetn` is low, the FSM stays in the `STATE_A` state and sets `f` and `g` to 0.
2. When `resetn` goes high, the FSM transitions to `STATE_B` on the next clock cycle and sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
3. The FSM then monitors the `x` input and transitions to `STATE_C` and `STATE_D` when the sequence `1, 0, 1` is detected on `x`.
4. In `STATE_D`, the FSM sets `g` to 1 and monitors the `y` input. If `y` becomes 1 within 2 clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within 2 clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently.
5. The FSM returns to `STATE_A` when the sequence `1, 0, 1` on `x` is not followed by the expected behavior on `y`.'}
