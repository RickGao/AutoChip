{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The Verilog module provided implements a finite state machine that can receive a serial data stream with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The state machine handles the following cases:

1. **IDLE**: The module waits for the start bit (0) to be detected on the `in` input.
2. **START**: The module detects the start bit and starts counting the bit positions.
3. **RECEIVE**: The module receives the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
4. **STOP**: The module checks for the presence of the stop bit (1). If the stop bit is detected, the `done` output is set high. If the stop bit is not detected, the module transitions to the **ERROR** state.
5. **ERROR**: The module waits for the stop bit (1) to be detected before returning to the **IDLE** state.

The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality, where the state machine is reset to the **IDLE** state and the `done` output is set low upon the `reset` input being high.'}
