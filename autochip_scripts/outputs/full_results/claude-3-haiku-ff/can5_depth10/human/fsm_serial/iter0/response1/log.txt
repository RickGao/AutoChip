{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset.

This Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The FSM has the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
2. `START_BIT`: Verifying the start bit.
3. `DATA_BIT`: Capturing the 8 data bits.
4. `STOP_BIT`: Verifying the stop bit.

The module takes the following inputs:
- `clk`: The system clock.
- `in`: The serial data input.
- `reset`: An active-high synchronous reset.

The module has the following output:
- `done`: An active-high signal that indicates when a byte has been correctly received.

The module uses a `case` statement to transition between the different states of the FSM. When the start bit is detected, the FSM moves to the `START_BIT` state. If the start bit is valid, the FSM moves to the `DATA_BIT` state, where it captures the 8 data bits one by one. Once all 8 data bits have been captured, the FSM moves to the `STOP_BIT` state, where it verifies the presence of the stop bit. If the stop bit is valid, the `done` output is set high, and the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, waiting for the next start bit.

If the start bit or the stop bit is not detected as expected, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state and waits for the next start bit. The module also includes an active-high synchronous reset that clears the state, bit count, data, and the `done` output.'}
