```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [1:0] ena,
    input [99:0] data,
    output reg [99:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end
    else begin
        case (ena)
            2'b01: q <= {q[0], q[99:1]};  // Rotate right by one bit
            2'b10: q <= {q[98:0], q[99]}; // Rotate left by one bit
            default: q <= q;             // No rotation
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

The module takes in the following inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal
- `load`: An active-high signal to load the `data` into the register
- `ena[1:0]`: A 2-bit signal to control the rotation direction:
    - `2'b01`: Rotate right by one bit
    - `2'b10`: Rotate left by one bit
    - `2'b00` and `2'b11`: No rotation
- `data[99:0]`: The 100-bit data to be loaded into the register

The module outputs:
- `q[99:0]`: The contents of the 100-bit register after any rotation or load operation.

The `always` block handles the synchronous behavior of the module:
- If `load` is high, the `data` is loaded into the register `q`.
- Otherwise, the contents of `q` are rotated based on the `ena` signal:
    - For `2'b01`, the bits are rotated right by one position.
    - For `2'b10`, the bits are rotated left by one position.
    - For `2'b00` and `2'b11`, the contents of `q` are kept unchanged (no rotation).'}
