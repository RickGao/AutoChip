The provided Verilog module `top_module` implements a single stage of an n-bit shift register circuit. The inputs and outputs are as follows:

- `clk`: Clock signal
- `w`: Input to the first stage of the shift register
- `R`: Value to be loaded
- `E`: Enable signal for shifting
- `L`: Load signal
- `Q`: Output of the flip-flop

The module uses a single `always` block to update the output `Q` based on the input signals. If the `L` signal is asserted, the value of `R` is loaded into the flip-flop. If the `E` signal is asserted, the value of `w` is shifted into the flip-flop. If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the value of `Q` is retained.'}
