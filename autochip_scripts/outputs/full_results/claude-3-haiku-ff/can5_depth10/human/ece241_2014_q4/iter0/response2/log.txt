This Verilog module implements the given finite state machine circuit. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The module has three input/output ports: `clk`, `x`, and `z`.
2. It declares three internal registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` to store the outputs of the D flip-flops.
3. It creates three intermediate wires `xor_out`, `and_out`, and `or_out` to hold the outputs of the XOR, AND, and OR gates, respectively.
4. The XOR, AND, and OR gates are implemented using continuous assignment statements.
5. The D flip-flops are implemented using a `always` block that updates the values of `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` on the positive edge of the clock signal.
6. The XNOR gate is implemented using a continuous assignment statement that takes the XOR of `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`, and then negates the result to produce the final output `z`.

This Verilog code should correctly implement the given finite state machine circuit.'}
