{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock, an input `in[7:0]` for the input byte stream, an input `reset` for the synchronous reset, and an output `done` to signal when a complete 3-byte message has been received.

2. The module uses a 2-bit state variable to track the state of the finite state machine. The states are defined using the `localparam` construct as `WAIT_FIRST`, `WAIT_SECOND`, and `WAIT_THIRD`.

3. The `always` block updates the state and the `done` output based on the current state and the input byte.
   - If `reset` is active, the state is set to `WAIT_FIRST`, and `done` is set to 0.
   - In the `WAIT_FIRST` state, if the most significant bit (`in[3]`) of the input byte is 1, the state is updated to `WAIT_SECOND`, and `done` is kept at 0.
   - In the `WAIT_SECOND` state, the state is updated to `WAIT_THIRD`.
   - In the `WAIT_THIRD` state, the state is updated back to `WAIT_FIRST`, and `done` is set to 1 to signal that a complete 3-byte message has been received.

The corrected module should correctly detect the start of a 3-byte message and signal its completion in the cycle immediately after the third byte is received.'}
