{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the finite state machine to detect the boundaries of the 3-byte PS/2 mouse protocol messages. The FSM has three states:

1. `STATE_WAIT_FIRST`: Waits for the first byte of the message, which has `in[3]` set to 1.
2. `STATE_WAIT_SECOND`: Waits for the second byte of the message.
3. `STATE_WAIT_THIRD`: Waits for the third byte of the message, and then sets the `done` output high to indicate that a complete message has been received.

The `reset` input is handled correctly, resetting the FSM to the `STATE_WAIT_FIRST` state and setting the `done` output low.'}
