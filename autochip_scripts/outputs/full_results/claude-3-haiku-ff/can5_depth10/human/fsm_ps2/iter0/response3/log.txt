{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The key changes made to the original code are:

1. Defined the necessary states for the finite state machine: `STATE_WAIT`, `STATE_BYTE1`, `STATE_BYTE2`, and `STATE_BYTE3`.
2. Introduced a `byte_count` register to track the current byte position within the message.
3. Implemented the state transition logic based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.
4. Set the `done` output signal to 1 only in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.
5. Ensured that the `done` output is reset to 0 in all other cases.
6. Added a default case to handle any unexpected state transitions.

This corrected module should now correctly identify and signal the completion of each 3-byte PS/2 mouse protocol message.'}
