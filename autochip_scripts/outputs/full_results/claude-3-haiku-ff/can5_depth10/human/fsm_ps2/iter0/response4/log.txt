{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The key aspects are:

1. The module has four states: `STATE_WAIT`, `STATE_BYTE1`, `STATE_BYTE2`, and `STATE_BYTE3`.
2. In the `STATE_WAIT` state, the module waits for the first byte of a message, which is indicated by `in[3]` being 1.
3. Once the first byte is received, the module transitions to `STATE_BYTE1`, and then sequentially transitions through `STATE_BYTE2` and `STATE_BYTE3` as the remaining two bytes are received.
4. When the third byte is received in the `STATE_BYTE3` state, the `done` output is set to 1 to signal that a complete message has been received.
5. The module resets to the `STATE_WAIT` state when the `reset` input is high.'}
