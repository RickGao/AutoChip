{'role': 'user', 'content': "// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);"}

    end
end

endmodule
```

The main issues with the previous module were:

1. The `done` output was not being updated correctly. It should be set to `1'b1` in the `WAIT_THIRD` state and `1'b0` in the other states.
2. The state transition from `WAIT_FIRST` was missing the case where `in[3]` is `0`. In this case, the state should remain in `WAIT_FIRST`.

With these corrections, the module should now work as expected and pass the testbench.'}
