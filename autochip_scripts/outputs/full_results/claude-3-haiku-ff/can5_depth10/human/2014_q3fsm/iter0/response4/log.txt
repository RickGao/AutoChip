This Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. The FSM has three states: A, B, and C. State A is the initial reset state, and the FSM transitions to state B when the input `s` is 1. In state B, the FSM checks the input `w` for the next three clock cycles and sets the output `z` accordingly. After that, the FSM transitions to state C, where it checks `w` for the next three clock cycles and sets `z` accordingly. The FSM then transitions back to state B and the process continues.

The module uses a `state` register to keep track of the current state, and a `count` register to keep track of the number of clock cycles in the current state. The `reset` input is used to reset the FSM to the initial state A and clear the output `z`.'}
