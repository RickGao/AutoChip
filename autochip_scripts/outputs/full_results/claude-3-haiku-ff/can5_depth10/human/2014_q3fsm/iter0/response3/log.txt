The provided Verilog module implements the finite state machine as described in the problem statement. It has three states:

1. `A`: The initial reset state, where the FSM remains as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, it transitions to state `B`.
2. `B`: In this state, the FSM examines the value of `w` for the next three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
3. `C`: This state is used to handle the case where `w` is 1 in exactly two clock cycles out of the three. The FSM transitions back to state `B` after setting `z` to 1.

The module uses a counter (`count`) to keep track of the number of clock cycles where `w` is 1. The `reset` input is handled synchronously, resetting the state to `A` and the output `z` to 0.'}
