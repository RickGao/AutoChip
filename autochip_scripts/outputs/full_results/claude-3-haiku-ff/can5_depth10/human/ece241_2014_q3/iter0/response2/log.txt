The Verilog code above implements the given Karnaugh map using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and three 2-to-1 multiplexers. The inputs `c` and `d` are used as the selector inputs for the multiplexers.

The circuit implementation is as follows:

1. `mux_in[0]` is directly connected to `c`.
2. `mux_in[1]` is directly connected to `d`.
3. `mux_in[2]` is connected to the output of a 2-to-1 multiplexer, where the selector input is `c` and the data inputs are `d` and `1'b1`.
4. `mux_in[3]` is connected to the output of a 2-to-1 multiplexer, where the selector input is `d` and the data inputs are `(c) ? 1'b1 : d` and `1'b1`.

This combination of multiplexers implements the given Karnaugh map.'}
