The provided Verilog code is correct and should work as expected. Here's how it works:

1. The `in_prev` register is used to store the previous value of the `in` input signal.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`@(posedge clk)`), the current value of `in` is stored in the `in_prev` register.
3. The `anyedge` output is then set to the result of the XOR operation between the current `in` value and the previous `in_prev` value. This effectively sets the `anyedge` bit high for the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs on any bit of the `in` vector.'}
