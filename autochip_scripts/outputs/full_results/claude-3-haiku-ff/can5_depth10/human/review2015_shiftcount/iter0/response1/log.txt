The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key aspects are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal, `shift_ena` and `count_ena` as control inputs, `data` as the input data, and `q` as the 4-bit output register.
2. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
3. If `shift_ena` is high, the shift register is updated by shifting the input `data` into the most significant bit, and shifting the existing contents of `q` one bit to the right.
4. If `count_ena` is high, the value in `q` is decremented by 1.
5. Since `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are not used together, the module simply prioritizes the shift operation over the decrement operation when both are high.

This implementation should meet the requirements of the given specification.'}
