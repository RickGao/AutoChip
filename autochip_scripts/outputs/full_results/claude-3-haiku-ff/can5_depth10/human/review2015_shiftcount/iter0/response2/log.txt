The provided Verilog module specification is correct and can be implemented as shown above. The key points are:

1. The module has an input `clk` for the clock signal.
2. The input `shift_ena` controls the shifting of the 4-bit register. When it is 1, the new data is shifted into the MSB, and the existing bits are shifted to the right.
3. The input `count_ena` controls the decrementing of the 4-bit register. When it is 1, the value in the register is decremented by 1.
4. The output `q` is a 4-bit register that holds the current value.
5. The `always` block handles the two cases of shifting and decrementing based on the control inputs.
6. Since the specification states that `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are not used together, the order of the `if-else` statements doesn't matter.

This implementation should provide the required functionality for the four-bit shift register with a down counter.'}
