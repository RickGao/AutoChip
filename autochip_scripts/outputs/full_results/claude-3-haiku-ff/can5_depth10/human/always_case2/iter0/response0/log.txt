{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero.

The provided Verilog module is a 4-bit priority encoder that correctly identifies the position of the first '1' bit in the input vector. The `always @(*)` block uses a `casez` statement to check the input bits and assign the corresponding output value to the `pos` register.

The `casez` statement handles the following cases:
1. `4'b1???`: If the most significant bit is '1', the position is '00'.
2. `4'b01??`: If the second most significant bit is '1', the position is '01'.
3. `4'b001?`: If the third most significant bit is '1', the position is '10'.
4. `4'b0001`: If the least significant bit is '1', the position is '11'.
5. `default`: If none of the input bits are '1', the position is '00'.

This module correctly implements the priority encoder functionality as per the given problem statement.'}
