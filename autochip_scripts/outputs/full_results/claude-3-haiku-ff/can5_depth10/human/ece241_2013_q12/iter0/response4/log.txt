{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit\'s behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. \n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput enable,\n\tinput S,\n\tinput A,\n\tinput B,\n\tinput C,\n\toutput reg Z\n);'}

The provided Verilog code implements an 8-bit shift register with a synchronous active-high enable input, and uses a combinational logic block to select the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the inputs A, B, and C, and assign it to the output Z.

The shift register is implemented using a single always block that shifts the contents of the 8-bit register Q to the left, with the new bit from the input S being shifted in at the least significant bit.

The output logic is implemented using a case statement that selects the appropriate bit from the shift register based on the values of A, B, and C, and assigns it to the output Z.

This circuit can be used to realize a 3-input logic function by storing the desired output values in the shift register, and then selecting the appropriate bit based on the input values A, B, and C.'}
