This Verilog module implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input `x` is a series of bits, and the output `z` is the 2's complement of the input.

The module has three states:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state, waiting for the reset to be released.
2. `CONVERT`: The state where the input bits are shifted into the `result` register and the 2's complement is computed.
3. `DONE`: The state where the 2's complement is output, and the module waits for the next reset.

The module uses an asynchronous reset, and the conversion begins when the reset is released and stops when the reset is asserted.'}
