The corrected Verilog module implements a Moore state machine to perform the 2's complement operation on the input bits. The module has the following states:

1. `WAIT`: The module waits for the `areset` signal to be deasserted, indicating the start of the conversion.
2. `COMPLEMENT`: In this state, the module shifts the current `temp_sum` value to the left by one bit and appends the current input bit `x`. It then checks if the MSB of `temp_sum` is 0 (positive number) or 1 (negative number) and outputs the 2's complement accordingly. The state remains in `COMPLEMENT` until the `areset` signal is asserted, indicating the end of the conversion.
3. `DONE`: In this state, the module simply outputs the final 2's complement value.

The module uses a `next_state`, `next_temp_sum`, and `next_z` variables to update the state, the temporary sum, and the output `z` on the next clock cycle, respectively.'}
