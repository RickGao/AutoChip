The provided Verilog module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`. The module has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The module also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, and uses only 3 states in the state machine.

The state machine recognizes overlapping sequences by returning to the `IDLE` state after the "101" sequence is detected, allowing the recognition of the next sequence.'}
