{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) that can identify when bytes have been correctly received in a serial communication protocol. The protocol uses one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and one stop bit (1), with the line being at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle).

The module has the following states:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
- `START`: Detecting the start bit.
- `DATA`: Receiving the 8 data bits.
- `STOP`: Verifying the stop bit.
- `ERROR`: Handling the case where the stop bit is not received as expected.

The module has the following inputs and outputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal.
- `in`: The incoming serial data.
- `reset`: The synchronous reset signal.
- `out_byte`: The correctly-received data byte.
- `done`: A signal that is asserted when a byte has been correctly received.

The module operates as follows:
1. In the `IDLE` state, it waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
2. When the start bit is detected, it moves to the `START` state and waits for the start bit to end.
3. In the `DATA` state, it receives the 8 data bits, shifting them into the `data_reg` register.
4. After receiving all 8 data bits, it moves to the `STOP` state to verify the stop bit.
5. If the stop bit is received correctly (1), it outputs the received byte (`out_byte`) and asserts the `done` signal.
6. If the stop bit is not received as expected, it moves to the `ERROR` state and waits until a stop bit is finally received before attempting to receive the next byte.

The module handles the case where the stop bit is not received as expected by waiting in the `ERROR` state until a stop bit is detected before attempting to receive the next byte. This ensures that the module can correctly identify and process the serial data stream.'}
