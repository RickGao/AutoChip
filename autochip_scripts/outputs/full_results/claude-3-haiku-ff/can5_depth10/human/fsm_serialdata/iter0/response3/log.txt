{'role': 'user', 'content': "// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should assert done each time it finds a stop bit.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [7:0] out_byte,\n\toutput done\n);"}

The provided Verilog module correctly implements the desired finite state machine to detect and extract data bytes from a serial stream, as per the given specification. The module handles the following:

1. **Idle State**: Waits for the start bit (logic 0) to be detected.
2. **Start State**: Verifies the start bit is present.
3. **Data State**: Shifts in the 8 data bits, least significant bit first.
4. **Stop State**: Verifies the stop bit (logic 1) is present, and if so, latches the received data byte into `out_byte` and asserts the `done` signal.

The module also includes a synchronous, active-high reset functionality to reset the state machine and its internal registers.'}
