{'assistant': 'Thank you for providing the additional information. Based on the error output, it seems that the initial value of the output `out` is not being properly initialized. Let me update the module to address this issue:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input in,
    output logic out
);

logic xor_out;

// XOR gate
assign xor_out = in ^ out;

// D flip-flop
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= xor_out;
end

initial begin
    out = 0; // Initialize the output to 0
end

endmodule
```

The key change is the addition of the `initial` block that initializes the `out` signal to 0. This should resolve the mismatch observed in the simulation.'}
