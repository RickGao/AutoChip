The provided Verilog module specification is correct, and the completed Verilog module is as shown above. The module takes an 8-bit input `in` and assigns the output `out` by reversing the bit order of `in`. Specifically, `out[0]` is assigned the value of `in[7]`, `out[1]` is assigned the value of `in[6]`, and so on, effectively reversing the bit order of the input.'}
