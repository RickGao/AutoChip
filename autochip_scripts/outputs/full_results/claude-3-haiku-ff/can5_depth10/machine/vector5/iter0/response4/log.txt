The original code had a couple of issues:
1. The input/output declarations were not properly formatted.
2. The computation of the two 25-bit vectors was not correct. The code now correctly creates the negated and positive forms of the input signals.
3. The final assignment of the output `out` now correctly performs the bitwise XOR operation as described in the module specification.'}
