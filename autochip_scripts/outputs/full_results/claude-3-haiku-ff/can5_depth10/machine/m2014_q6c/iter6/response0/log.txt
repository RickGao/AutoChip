{'assistant': 'I apologize, but I do not see any issues with the provided Verilog module. The module seems to be correct and should generate the desired outputs Y2 and Y4 based on the given inputs y and w.

If the testbench is still experiencing errors, there may be an issue with the testbench itself or the way the inputs are being provided. I would suggest double-checking the testbench and the input stimuli to ensure they are correct.

Without any further information about the specific errors or the testbench, I cannot provide a more detailed solution. If you can share the complete testbench code, I may be able to help you identify the issue.'}
