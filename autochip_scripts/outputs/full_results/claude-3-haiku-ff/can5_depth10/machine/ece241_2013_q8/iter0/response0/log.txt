```

The corrected module includes the following changes:

1. Defined a 2-bit state register to represent the different states (S, S1, S10).
2. Implemented the state transition logic using a case statement based on the current state and input `x`.
3. Implemented the output logic using a case statement based on the current state.
4. Implemented the state register update logic using a synchronous reset based on the `aresetn` signal.

The module now correctly implements the given state machine behavior.'}
