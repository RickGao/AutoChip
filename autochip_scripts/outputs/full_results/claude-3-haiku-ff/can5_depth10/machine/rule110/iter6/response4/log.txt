{'assistant': 'I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. Let me try to fix the module again based on the provided specification:

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end else begin
        q <= {q[510:0], ~(q[511:510] == 2'b10)};
    end
end

endmodule

The key changes are:
1. The bitwise operation is simplified to a single comparison of the two most significant bits of `q` to determine the new least significant bit.
2. The shift operation is changed to a single concatenation to shift the bits one position to the left.

This should fix the issue and pass the testbench.'}
