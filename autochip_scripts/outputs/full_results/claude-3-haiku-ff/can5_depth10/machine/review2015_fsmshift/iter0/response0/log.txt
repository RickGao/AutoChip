The key changes made are:

1. Declared the `state` register as a 3-bit register.
2. Implemented the state transition logic in the first `always` block, transitioning from B0 to B1, B1 to B2, B2 to B3, and B3 to Done.
3. Implemented the `shift_ena` assignment logic in the second `always` block, based on the current state.
4. Ensured that the module always goes to state B0 when `reset` is 1, and goes to the Done state for any other invalid state.

This should provide the desired functionality as per the given specification.'}
