The corrections made are:

1. Declared the `q_next` register to hold the next state value.
2. In the first `always` block, the assignments to `q_next` are corrected:
   - `q_next[4:1] = q[3:0];` to get the upper 4 bits of the next state.
   - `q_next[0] = q[4];` to get the LSB of the current state.
   - `q_next[2] = q[0] ^ q_next[2];` to XOR the LSB of the current state with bit 2 of the next state.
3. In the second `always` block, the assignment to `q` is corrected to use the `q_next` value on the positive edge of `clk`.'}
