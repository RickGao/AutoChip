This Verilog module implements the desired functionality as per the specification provided. The key points are:

1. The module has two always blocks - one for defining the state transition logic and the other for updating the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. In the first always block, `q_next` is assigned the value of `q[4:1]` (the upper 4 bits of `q`), followed by assigning `q_next[4]` with `q[0]` (the LSB of `q`), and finally `q_next[2]` is assigned the XOR of `q[0]` and `q_next[2]`.
3. In the second always block, if `reset` is active, `q` is assigned the reset value of `5'h1`. Otherwise, `q` is assigned the value of `q_next`, which is the result of the state transition logic.

The module is now complete and should compile without any errors.'}
