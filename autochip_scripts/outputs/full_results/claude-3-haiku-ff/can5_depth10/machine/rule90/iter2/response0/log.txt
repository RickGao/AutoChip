{'assistant': 'Apologies for the previous incorrect module. Let me take another look at the problem and provide a corrected version.

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load)
        q <= data;
    else
        q <= {1'b0, q[511:1]};
end

endmodule

The issue with the previous implementation was that it was shifting the bits in the wrong direction. Instead of shifting the bits to the right and adding a 0 at the end, the correct operation is to shift the bits to the left and add a 0 at the beginning.

The corrected code shifts the bits in the q register one position to the left and adds a 0 at the most significant bit position, effectively shifting the entire register one bit to the left and adding a 0 at the end.

This should fix the mismatch issues reported in the simulation output.'}
