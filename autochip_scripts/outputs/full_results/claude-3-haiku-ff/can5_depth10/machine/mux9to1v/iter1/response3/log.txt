    input [15:0] d,
    input [15:0] e,

        default: out = 16'h0001; // Changed the default value to 16'h0001 instead of 16'h1
    endcase
end

endmodule

The issue was in the default case, where the output was being assigned a constant value of 16'h1. This was causing the mismatch in the testbench. I've updated the default case to assign a value of 16'h0001, which should resolve the issue.'}
