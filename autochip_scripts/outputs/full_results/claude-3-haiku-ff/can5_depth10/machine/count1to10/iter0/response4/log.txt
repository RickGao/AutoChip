{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is a simple counter that increments its output q by one every clock cycle. It has 3 inputs, a clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and an output register (q). The output register is a 4-bit register, meaning it can store values from 0 to 15.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the output register is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active, the output register is incremented by one. When the output register reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it is reset to 1. This process is repeated every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [3:0] q);'}

The provided Verilog module specification is correct and complete. The completed Verilog module is provided as requested, with the following implementation:

1. The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `q`.
2. The output `q` is a 4-bit register, which can store values from 0 to 15.
3. The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal using the `always @(posedge clk)` construct.
4. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the `reset` signal:
   - If `reset` is active, the output `q` is set to 1.
   - If `reset` is not active, the module checks the current value of `q`:
     - If `q` is equal to 10, it is reset to 1.
     - Otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.

This implementation matches the provided module specification and should function as a simple counter that increments its output `q` by one every clock cycle, resetting to 1 when it reaches 10.'}
