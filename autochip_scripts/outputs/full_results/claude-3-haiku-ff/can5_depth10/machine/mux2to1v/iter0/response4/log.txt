The corrected Verilog module is as follows:

1. The `out` port is declared as `output reg [99:0] out` to indicate that it is a registered output.
2. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the `out` output is assigned based on the value of the `sel` input signal.
3. If `sel` is 0, the value of `a` is assigned to `out`.
4. If `sel` is 1, the value of `b` is assigned to `out`.'}
