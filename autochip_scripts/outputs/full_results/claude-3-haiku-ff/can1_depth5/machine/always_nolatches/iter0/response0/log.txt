The corrected Verilog module correctly implements the given specification. The key changes are:

1. Initialized all output registers to 0 in the `always @(*)` block to ensure no latches are created.
2. Used a `case` statement to check the scancode value and set the corresponding output register to 1.
3. Included a `default` case to handle any other scancode values not listed in the specification.

This module should now compile and function as expected.'}
