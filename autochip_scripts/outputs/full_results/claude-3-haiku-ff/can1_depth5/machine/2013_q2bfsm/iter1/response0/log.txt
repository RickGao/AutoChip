The key changes are:

1. Added a default case to the state transition logic to ensure the state machine is properly initialized.
2. Moved the assignment of `f` and `g` to the case statement, instead of using separate logic. This ensures the outputs are correctly updated based on the current state.

These changes should address the issues reported in the simulation output.'}
