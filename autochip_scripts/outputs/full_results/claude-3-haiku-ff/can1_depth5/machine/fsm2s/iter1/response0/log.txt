The main changes are:

1. The reset input is now handled synchronously in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, as suggested in the hint.
2. The `always @(*)` block for the `out` output has been corrected to use a case statement instead of an if-else chain.

These changes should address the issues reported in the simulation output.'}
