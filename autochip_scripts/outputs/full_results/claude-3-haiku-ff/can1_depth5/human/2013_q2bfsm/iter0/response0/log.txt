{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput resetn,\n\tinput x,\n\tinput y,\n\toutput f,\n\toutput g\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the finite state machine described in the problem statement. The module has the following states:

- `STATE_A`: The initial state where the reset signal is asserted. In this state, the output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle.
- `STATE_B`: The state where the module monitors the `x` input to detect the sequence `1, 0, 1`. The `x_count` variable keeps track of the number of consecutive `x` values.
- `STATE_C`: The state where the output `g` is set to 1. The module then monitors the `y` input to see if it becomes 1 within the next two clock cycles.
- `STATE_D`: The state where the output `g` is maintained at 1 permanently (until reset) if `y` became 1 within the two clock cycles.

The module uses a set of `always` blocks to handle the state transitions and update the outputs based on the inputs and the current state.'}
