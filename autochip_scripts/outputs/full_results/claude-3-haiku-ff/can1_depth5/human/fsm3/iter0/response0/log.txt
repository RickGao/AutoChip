The provided Verilog module implements the given state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. The module includes a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A.

The key elements of the implementation are:

1. `state` and `next_state` registers to store the current and next state, respectively.
2. The `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block to update the current state based on the reset or the next state.
3. The `always @(*)` block to determine the next state based on the current state and the input, and to set the output based on the current state.
4. The state definitions using `localparam` for the four states (A, B, C, D).
5. The case statements to implement the state transition logic and the output logic.

The module should now correctly implement the given state transition table and provide the desired functionality.'}
