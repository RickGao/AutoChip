{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:\n// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0\n// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0\n// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 \n// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [511:0] data,\n\toutput reg [511:0] q);"}

The provided Verilog code implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton. The module takes in a 512-bit input `data` and a load signal `load`. On each clock cycle, if `load` is high, the state of the system is loaded from `data`. Otherwise, the next state of the system is computed according to the Rule 110 transition rules.

The transition rules are implemented as follows:
- The first cell `q[0]` is updated based on its own value, the value of the last cell `q[511]`, and the value of the next cell `q[1]`.
- For the intermediate cells `q[1]` to `q[510]`, the next state is computed based on the values of the previous cell `q[i-1]`, the current cell `q[i]`, and the next cell `q[i+1]`.
- The last cell `q[511]` is updated based on the value of the previous cell `q[510]`, its own value `q[511]`, and a constant value of 0 (since the boundary condition is set to 0).

This implementation correctly advances the state of the 512-cell Rule 110 cellular automaton by one time step on each clock cycle.'}
