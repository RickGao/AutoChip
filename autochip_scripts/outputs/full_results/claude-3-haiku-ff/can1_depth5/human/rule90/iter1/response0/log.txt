The changes made are:
1. Changed the part select for the rightmost cell from `q[512:1]` to `{q[510:0], 1'b0}` to handle the out-of-bounds issue.
2. Changed the part select for the leftmost cell from `q[0]` to `q[1] ^ 1'b0` to handle the out-of-bounds issue.

These changes ensure that the module compiles without any warnings.'}
