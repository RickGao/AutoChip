{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a 100-bit left/right rotator, with synchronous load and left/right enable.

{'assistant': 'Here is the corrected Verilog module for the 100-bit left/right rotator:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [1:0] ena,
    input [99:0] data,
    output reg [99:0] q

            2'b01: q <= {q[0], q[99:1]};  // Rotate right by one bit
            2'b10: q <= {q[98:0], q[99]}; // Rotate left by one bit
            // 2'b00 and 2'b11 do not rotate
            default: q <= q;
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

The key changes made are:

1. Added a `always @(posedge clk)` block to make the module synchronous with the clock.
2. Implemented the load functionality where the `data` input is loaded into `q` when `load` is high.
3. Implemented the rotate functionality in the `else` block, where the `ena` input is used to determine the rotation direction.
   - For right rotation, the MSB of `q` is moved to the LSB position.
   - For left rotation, the LSB of `q` is moved to the MSB position.
   - For `ena` values of 2'b00 and 2'b11, the value of `q` remains unchanged.

This Verilog module should now correctly implement the 100-bit left/right rotator with synchronous load and left/right enable.'}
