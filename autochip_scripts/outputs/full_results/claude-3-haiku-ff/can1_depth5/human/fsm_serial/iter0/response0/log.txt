{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

The corrected Verilog module above implements the finite state machine as per the given specification. The key features are:

1. The module has four states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP.
2. In the IDLE state, it waits for the start bit (0) to be detected.
3. In the START state, it shifts in the 8 data bits, one by one.
4. In the DATA state, it checks if the stop bit (1) is received. If so, it sets the `done` output high and transitions to the STOP state. If the stop bit is not detected, it transitions back to the IDLE state.
5. In the STOP state, it resets the `done` output and transitions back to the IDLE state.
6. The module also includes a synchronous reset functionality that resets the state machine and all internal registers when the `reset` input is high.'}
