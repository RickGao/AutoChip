The issue with the original module was that the `start_shifting` output was not being set correctly. In the corrected module, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 when the state reaches `S3`, which indicates that the sequence `1101` has been detected. The `start_shifting` output remains at 1 until the `reset` input is asserted.'}
