The provided Verilog code implements a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. Here's how it works:

1. The module has two internal registers, `d_reg1` and `d_reg2`, which are used to capture the input data `d` on the positive edge of the clock.
2. In the `always` block, the input data `d` is first stored in `d_reg1` on the positive edge of the clock.
3. On the next positive edge of the clock, the value in `d_reg1` is stored in `d_reg2`.
4. The output `q` is then assigned the exclusive-OR (XOR) of `d_reg1` and `d_reg2`. This effectively makes `q` toggle on both the positive and negative edges of the clock, mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

By using this approach, we can achieve the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop without relying on a construct that is not supported by FPGAs, such as `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)`.'}
