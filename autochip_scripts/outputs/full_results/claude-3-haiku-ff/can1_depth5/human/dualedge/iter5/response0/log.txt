{'assistant': 'Apologies for the previous incorrect solutions. Here's the corrected module that should pass the testbench:

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg d_reg1, d_reg2;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
        if (clk) begin
            d_reg1 <= d;
        end else begin
            d_reg2 <= d_reg1;
            q <= d_reg1 ^ d_reg2;
        end
    end

endmodule

The key changes are:

1. The `always` block is sensitive to both the positive and negative edges of the clock.
2. Inside the `always` block, the `d_reg1` assignment happens on the positive edge, while the `d_reg2` assignment and `q` output happen on the negative edge.

This way, the module captures the input on both edges of the clock and produces the correct dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior.'}
