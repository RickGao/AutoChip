The provided Verilog code implements the desired Moore state machine. The state machine has two states, `A` and `B`, with the reset state being `B`. The output `out` is assigned based on the current state, where `out` is `1` when the state is `B`, and `0` when the state is `A`.

The state transitions are handled in the `always` block, which is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The state transitions are determined based on the current state and the input signal `in`. When the `reset` signal is high, the state is set to `B`.'}
