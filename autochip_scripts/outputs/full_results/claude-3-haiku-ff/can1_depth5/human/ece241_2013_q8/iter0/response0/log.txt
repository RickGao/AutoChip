The provided Verilog code implements a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x`. The FSM has an output signal `z` that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM has a negative edge-triggered asynchronous reset and uses 3 states.

The FSM recognizes overlapping sequences, meaning it can detect the "101" sequence even if the input `x` continues to be 1 after the sequence is detected.

The `state` register holds the current state of the FSM, and the `next_state` logic determines the next state based on the current state and the input `x`. The `z` output is set based on the current state.'}
