The corrected Verilog module performs the following:

1. Declares a register `in_prev` to store the previous input value.
2. In the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, it does the following:
   - Assigns the current input `in` to `in_prev`, effectively storing the previous input value.
   - Assigns the output `pedge` to the bitwise AND of the current input `in` and the negation of the previous input `~in_prev`. This detects the 0 to 1 transition for each bit in the 8-bit vector.'}
