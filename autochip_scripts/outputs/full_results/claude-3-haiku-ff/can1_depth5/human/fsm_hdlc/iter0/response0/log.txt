{'role': 'user', 'content': '// Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

This Verilog module implements a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize the three sequences described in the problem statement:

1. `0111110`: Discard a bit (output `disc` is asserted)
2. `01111110`: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (output `flag` is asserted)
3. `01111111...`: Error (output `err` is asserted)

The module has the following inputs and outputs:

- `clk`: Clock signal
- `reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal
- `in`: Input bit stream
- `disc`: Output signal to indicate a bit needs to be discarded
- `flag`: Output signal to indicate the beginning/end of a frame
- `err`: Output signal to indicate an error condition

The module uses three states to recognize the different sequences:

1. `IDLE`: The initial state, where the module waits for the input to become 1.
2. `WAIT_DISC`: The module has detected `0111110` and should assert the `disc` output.
3. `WAIT_FLAG`: The module has detected `01111110` and should assert the `flag` output.
4. `WAIT_ERR`: The module has detected `01111111` and should assert the `err` output.

The module updates its current state based on the current input and the next state logic. The output signals are generated based on the current state.

The module ensures that the reset signal sets the initial state to `IDLE`, which behaves as if the previous input were 0.'}
