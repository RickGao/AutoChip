The corrected module achieves the desired functionality. The key changes are:

1. Added a register `count` to keep track of the remaining cycles to enable the shift register.
2. In the reset condition, `count` is initialized to 3 (4 cycles) and `shift_ena` is asserted.
3. In the non-reset condition, if `count` is non-zero, it is decremented and `shift_ena` remains asserted.
4. When `count` reaches 0, `shift_ena` is deasserted.

This ensures that whenever the module is reset, the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles, and then remains deasserted until the next reset.'}
