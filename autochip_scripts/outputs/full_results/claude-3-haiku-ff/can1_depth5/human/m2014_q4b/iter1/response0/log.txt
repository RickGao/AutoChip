{'assistant': 'I apologize for the issues with the previous module. Let me provide a corrected version of the D flip-flop module:

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    input ar,
    output logic q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk, negedge ar) begin
        if (!ar)
            q <= 1'b0;
        else
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule

The key changes are:

1. I have used the `always_ff` construct to clearly indicate this is a sequential block.
2. The sensitivity list includes both the positive edge of `clk` and the negedge of `ar`, to properly handle the asynchronous reset.
3. The reset logic sets `q` to `1'b0` when `ar` is low, and the normal D-FF logic is used when `ar` is high.

This should address the issues reported in the test bench and provide a correct implementation of the D flip-flop.'}
