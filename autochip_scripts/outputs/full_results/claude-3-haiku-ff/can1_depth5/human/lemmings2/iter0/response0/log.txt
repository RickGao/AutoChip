{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings\' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it\'s bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it\'s bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput bump_left,\n\tinput bump_right,\n\tinput ground,\n\toutput walk_left,\n\toutput walk_right,\n\toutput aaah\n);'}

This Verilog module implements the Moore state machine for the Lemmings game as described in the problem statement. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk`: Clock signal
- `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal
- `bump_left`: Indicates a bump on the left side
- `bump_right`: Indicates a bump on the right side
- `ground`: Indicates the presence of ground

Outputs:
- `walk_left`: Indicates the Lemming is walking left
- `walk_right`: Indicates the Lemming is walking right
- `aaah`: Indicates the Lemming is falling and saying "aaah!"

The module has a single state variable `state` that can take two values: `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`. The state transitions are handled in the always block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.

When `areset` is high, the module resets the state to `WALK_LEFT` and sets the corresponding output signals.

In the main state machine logic, the module checks the current state and the input signals to determine the next state and update the output signals accordingly. If the Lemming is walking left (`WALK_LEFT` state) and encounters a bump on the right (`bump_right`), it transitions to the `WALK_RIGHT` state. If the Lemming is walking right (`WALK_RIGHT` state) and encounters a bump on the left (`bump_left`), it transitions to the `WALK_LEFT` state.

Additionally, when the ground disappears (`!ground`), the module sets the `aaah` output signal to indicate that the Lemming is falling. When the ground reappears (`ground`), the Lemming resumes walking in the same direction as before the fall.'}
