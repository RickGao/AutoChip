{'role': 'user', 'content': "//  This top Verilog module implements a 32-bit shift register. The module has 3 ports: clk, reset, and q. The clk port is an input port that is used to synchronize the register. The reset port is an input port that is used to reset the register to the initial value. The q port is an output port that is used to output the value of the register. The module has two registers, q and q_next. The q_next register stores the next value of the register. The q register is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal. If the reset port is high, the register is reset to the initial value, 32'h1. Otherwise, the q register is updated with the value stored in the q_next register. The q_next register is updated on every clock cycle, and stores the value of the q register shifted by 1 bit. If the value of the q register is shifted out of bit 0, it is sent back to bit 31. Bits 21 and 1 are XORed with the value of bit 0. Bit 0 is also XORed with the value of bit 0.\n\n\n\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput reg [31:0] q);"}
