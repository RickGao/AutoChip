system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top module contains a 3 bit state register with the following state transition:

B0 -> B1 -> B2 -> B3 -> Done

B0 indicates that it is the first shift cycle.
B1 indicates that it is the second shift cycle.
B2 indicates that it is the third shift cycle.
B3 indicates that it is the fourth shift cycle.
Done indicates that it has completed the fourth shift cycle.

When the reset is 1, it will always go to state B0.
When the reset is 0, and state is not B0, B1, B2, or B3, it is in state Done.
shift_ena will be 1 if state is B0, B1, B2, or B3.
