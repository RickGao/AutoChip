{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. \n// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state. Active high synchronous.\n// (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.\n// The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput load,\n\tinput [255:0] data,\n\toutput reg [255:0] q);'}
