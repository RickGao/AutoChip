{'assistant': 'Given the mismatches observed in the simulation, we need to inspect the logic and ensure proper initialization. Here is the corrected module with appropriate D flip-flop initialization and proper complementary outputs:

```verilog
module top_module (

    output z
);

    reg q0, q1, q2;
    wire q0_bar, q1_bar, q2_bar;

        q1 <= d1;
        q2 <= d2;
    end

    assign q1_bar = ~q1;
    assign q2_bar = ~q2;

    assign d1 = x & q1_bar;
    assign d2 = x | q2_bar;

This correction ensures that `q0`, `q1`, and `q2` are correctly updated on the clock's positive edge and their complementary outputs are correctly defined and used for logic calculations.'}
