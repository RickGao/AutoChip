system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a top-level module which is used to write data to a 16-bit register. It has five inputs and one output. The inputs are a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (resetn), a 2-bit byte enable signal (byteena), and a 16-bit data signal (d). The output is a 16-bit register (q).  The module is triggered by a rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is low, the register is reset to 0. Otherwise, the data signal is written to the register based on the byte enable signal. If the first bit of the byte enable signal is high, the lower 8 bits of the data signal are written to the lower 8 bits of the register. If the second bit of the byte enable signal is high, the upper 8 bits of the data signal are written to the upper 8 bits of the register.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.
