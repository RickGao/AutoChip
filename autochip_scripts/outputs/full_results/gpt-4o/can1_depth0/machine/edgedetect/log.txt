system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is used to detect the rising edges of an 8-bit input signal. The module has three ports, a clock input, an 8-bit input signal, and an 8-bit output signal.   The clock input is used to synchronize the module's operations. The 8-bit input signal is used to detect the rising edges. The 8-bit output signal is used to indicate the rising edges.   The module contains a register, d_last, which is used to store the value of the input signal from the previous clock cycle.   The module is always triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When triggered, the module stores the current value of the 8-bit input signal in the d_last register. It then calculates the 8-bit output signal, pedge, by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current value of the 8-bit input signal and the inverse of the value stored in the d_last register. This results in a signal that is high only when a rising edge is detected.

	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,

		d_last <= in;
		// Compute the rising edge detection
		pedge <= in & (~d_last);
