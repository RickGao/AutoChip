system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple counter. It has one input, clk, one output, q, and one reset input. The clk input is used to trigger the counter. The reset input is used to reset the counter to 0. The output q is a 4-bit register that stores the current count value.  The module has an always block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal. Inside the always block, an if-else statement is used to determine the next value of q. If the reset input is asserted or the current value of q is equal to 9, then q is reset to 0. Otherwise, q is incremented by 1.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.
