system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module implements a JK flip-flop, which is a type of sequential logic circuit. It has three inputs (clk, j, and k) and one output (Q). The clock input (clk) is used to synchronize the circuit and the other two inputs (j and k) are used to control the state of the output (Q).   The module is declared with the keyword "module" followed by the name of the module ("top") and the list of ports (inputs and outputs). The module body contains an always block, which is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk). Inside the always block, the output (Q) is assigned a value based on the logic expression given. The expression is a combination of two logic operations, an AND operation and an OR operation. The AND operation is between the input j and the NOT of the output Q, and the OR operation is between the NOT of the input k and the output Q.   This expression implements the JK flip-flop logic. When the input j is high and the input k is low, the output Q will be set to the value of j. When the input j is low and the input k is high, the output Q will be reset to the value of 0. When both the inputs j and k are high, the output Q will toggle its value. When both the inputs j and k are low, the output Q will remain unchanged.
