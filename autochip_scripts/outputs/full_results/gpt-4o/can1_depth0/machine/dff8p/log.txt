system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple 8-bit register. It has four ports: clk, d, reset, and q. The clk port is an input that is used to clock the register. The d port is an 8-bit input that is used to store the data in the register. The reset port is an input that is used to reset the register to a predefined value. The q port is an 8-bit output that is used to output the data stored in the register.  The module has an always block that is triggered on the negative edge of the clk signal. Inside this block, there is an if statement that checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, the q port is set to 8'h34. If the reset signal is not asserted, the q port is set to the value of the d port. This allows the register to store the data from the d port.

	input clk,
	input [7:0] d,

	output reg [7:0] q);
