{'role': 'user', 'content': "// Build a two-bit saturating counter. The counter increments (up to a maximum of 3) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1. It decrements (down to a minimum of 0) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0. When not training (train_valid = 0), the counter keeps its value unchanged. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the counter to weakly not-taken (2'b01).
