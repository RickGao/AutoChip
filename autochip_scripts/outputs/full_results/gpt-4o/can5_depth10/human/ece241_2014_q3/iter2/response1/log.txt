Explanation:
The corrected assignments for the Karnaugh map are as follows:
- When `ab = 00`, our output should be `1` whenever either `c` or `d` is `1`, thus `mux_in[0]` can be assigned as `(d & ~c) | (~d & c) | (c & d)`.
- When `ab = 01`, all outputs are 0, so `mux_in[1]` is assigned 0.
- When `ab = 11`, our output should always be 1, so `mux_in[3]` is assigned 1.
- When `ab = 10`, the simplified assignment is `~c | (~d & c) | (~c & d)`.'}
