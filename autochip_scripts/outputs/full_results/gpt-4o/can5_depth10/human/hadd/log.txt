system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Create a half adder. A half adder adds two bits (with no carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.

assistant: module top_module (

    assign sum = a ^ b; // XOR gate for sum
    assign cout = a & b; // AND gate for carry-out
