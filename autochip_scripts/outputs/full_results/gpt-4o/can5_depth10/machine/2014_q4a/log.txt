system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a simple register that is used to store a single bit of data. It has five inputs (clk, w, R, E, and L) and one output (Q). The clock input (clk) is used to trigger the register to update its output (Q) when the clock signal transitions from low to high. The other inputs are used to control the behavior of the register.  The input w is the data that is to be stored in the register. The input R is used to reset the register to a known state. When R is high, the output Q is forced to a low state. The input E is used to enable the register. When E is low, the output Q is held in its current state. The input L is used to control whether the data stored in the register is updated with the value of w or the value of R. When L is high, the output Q is updated with the value of R. When L is low, the output Q is updated with the value of w.  The module is implemented using an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. The always block contains a conditional statement that checks the value of the L input. If L is high, the output Q is updated with the value of R. If L is low, the output Q is updated with the value of w. If E is low, the output Q is held in its current state.
