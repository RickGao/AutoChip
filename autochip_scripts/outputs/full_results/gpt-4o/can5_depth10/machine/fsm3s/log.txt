system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // This project is a FSM that has 4 states.
It has 3 inputs, clk, in and reset.
It has 1 output, out.
The 4 states are A, B, C, D and the initial state is A.
When the state is A, if the in is 1, the state changes to B,
otherwise the state remains to be A.
When the state is B, if the in is 1, the state changes to B,
otherwise the state changes to C.
When the state is C, if the in is 1, the state changes to D,
otherwise the state changes to A.
When the state is D, if the in is 1, the state changes to B,
otherwise the state changes to C.
When the reset is 1, the state changes to A.
The out is 1 when the state is D.
