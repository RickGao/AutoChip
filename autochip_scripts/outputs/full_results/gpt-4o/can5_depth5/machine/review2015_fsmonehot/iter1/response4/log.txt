{'assistant': 'Based on the testbench simulation results and the hints provided, it appears that the state machine is not handling random inputs correctly. To address this, I will implement a state machine using an `always` block to ensure proper state transitions and outputs. Let's rewrite the module with this approach:

    output reg S_next,
    output reg S1_next,
    output reg Count_next,
    output reg Wait_next,
    output reg done,
    output reg counting,
    output reg shift_ena
