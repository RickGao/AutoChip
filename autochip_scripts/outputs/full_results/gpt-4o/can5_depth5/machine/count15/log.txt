system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple 4-bit counter. It has three inputs: clk, reset, and q. The clk input is a clock signal, which is used to trigger the counter to increment. The reset input is a signal that, when asserted, will reset the counter to 0. The q output is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.  The module is implemented using an always block. This block is triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal. When the block is triggered, it first checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, the counter is reset to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. The incremented value is then stored in the q register.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.
