system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // We want to create a timer that:
// (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,
// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.
// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.
