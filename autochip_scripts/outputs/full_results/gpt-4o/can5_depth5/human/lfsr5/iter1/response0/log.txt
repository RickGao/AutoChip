A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3.
