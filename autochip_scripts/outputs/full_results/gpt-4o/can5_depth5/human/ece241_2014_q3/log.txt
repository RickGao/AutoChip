system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // For the following Karnaugh map, give the circuit implementation using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, but using as few as possible. You are not allowed to use any other logic gate and you must use _a_ and _b_ as the multiplexer selector inputs, as shown on the 4-to-1 multiplexer below.

//       ab
// cd   00 01 11 10

// Consider a block diagram with inputs 'c' and 'd' going into a module called "top_module". This "top_module" has four outputs, mux_in[3:0], that connect to a four input mux. The mux takes as input {a,b} and ab = 00 is connected to mux_in[0], ab=01 is connected to mux_in[1], and so in. You are implementing in Verilog just the portion labelled "top_module", such that the entire circuit (including the 4-to-1 mux) implements the K-map.
