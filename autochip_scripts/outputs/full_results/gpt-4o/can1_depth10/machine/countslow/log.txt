system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a 4-bit counter that increments its value by one every clock cycle when enabled. The module has four inputs: clk, slowena, reset, and four outputs: q. The clk input is a clock signal used to synchronize the counter. The slowena input is an enable signal that must be asserted for the counter to increment. The reset input is an asynchronous reset signal that resets the counter to 0 when asserted. The q output is a 4-bit register that stores the current value of the counter.   The module contains an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. Inside the always block, the module first checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, the counter is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not asserted, the module checks the slowena signal. If the slowena signal is asserted, the module checks the value of the counter. If the counter is equal to 9, the counter is reset to 0. If the counter is not equal to 9, the counter is incremented by 1. If the slowena signal is not asserted, the counter does not increment.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:

Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.
