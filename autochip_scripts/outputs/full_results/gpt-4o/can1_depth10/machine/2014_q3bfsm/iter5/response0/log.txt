The input x is the current input and the output z is the output of the module. The output is high when the state is D or E. The internal state is represented by 3 bits, so there are 8 states. The case statement describes the state transition when x is high or low. If the state is A and x is low, then the next state is also A. If the state is A and x is high, then the next state is B.
