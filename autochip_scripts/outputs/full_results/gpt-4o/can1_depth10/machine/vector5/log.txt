system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The input a, b, c, d, e are boolean signals. 
The output out is a 25-bit vector.

The module computes the bitwise exclusive-or of the  25-bit vector ~{ {5{a}}, {5{b}}, {5{c}}, {5{d}}, {5{e}} } and the 25-bit vector {5{a,b,c,d,e}}. The first vector consists of 25 bits with value 1 if the corresponding input signal is 0, and consists of 25 bits with value 0 if the corresponding input signal is 1. The second vector consists of 25 bits with value 1 if the corresponding input signal is 1, and consists of 25 bits with value 0 if the corresponding input signal is 0.
