system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple 8-bit register that is triggered by a clock signal. It has four ports: a clock (clk) input, a data (d) input, a reset input, and a data (q) output. The clock input is used to synchronize the register, the data input is used to set the value of the register, the reset input is used to reset the register to 0, and the data output is used to read the value of the register.   The module is implemented using an always block that is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset input is high, the output q is set to 0. Otherwise, the output q is set to the value of the data input d. This allows the register to store the value of the data input until it is reset or a new value is written.

user: The testbench simulated, but had errors. Please fix the module. The output of iverilog is as follows:
VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your reset should be synchronous, but doesn't appear to be.
