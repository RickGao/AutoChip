{'role': 'user', 'content': '// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput done\n);'}

Explanation of fixes:
1. Ensured `bit_cnt` is reset to 0 before starting to count data bits in the `RECEIVE_DATA` state by checking for 7 (since it's 0-indexed).
2. Added a `done_flag` internal signal to correctly control the `done` signal, ensuring it is asserted correctly when data reception is complete.
3. Corrected the logic for transitioning between `START_BIT` state and `RECEIVE_DATA` state by ensuring `bit_cnt` is correctly cleared.'}
