{'role': 'user', 'content': "// You are to design a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input (x) is a series of bits (one per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number, and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset. The conversion begins when Reset is released and stops when Reset is asserted.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput areset,\n\tinput x,\n\toutput z\n);"}
