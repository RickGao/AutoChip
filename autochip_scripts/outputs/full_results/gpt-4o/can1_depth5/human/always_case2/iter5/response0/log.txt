{'role': 'user', 'content': "// A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero.

The priority encoder for 4 bits should use a 2-bit wide output, capable of representing positions 0 through 3. Let's correct and ensure that the function handles all coding positions accurately including the case where all inputs are zero.
