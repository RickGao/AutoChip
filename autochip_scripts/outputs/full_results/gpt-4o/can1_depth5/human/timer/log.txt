system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Implement a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given duration has elapsed. A good way to implement this is with a down-counter that asserts an output signal when the count becomes 0. At each clock cycle: 
// (1) If load = 1, load the internal counter with the 10-bit data, the number of clock cycles the timer should count before timing out. The counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. 
// (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.
