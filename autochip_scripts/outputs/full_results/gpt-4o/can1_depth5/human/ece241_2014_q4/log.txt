system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // Given the finite state machine circuit described below, assume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins.

// Build this circuit in Verilog.

// Input x goes to three different two-input gates: a XOR, an AND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of a D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input XNOR, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding flip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding flip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR is its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.
