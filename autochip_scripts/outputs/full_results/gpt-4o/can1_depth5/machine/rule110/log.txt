system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top module is a register that uses the input "load" to determine whether to load the value in data into q. 
If load is true, q is set to the value of data.
If load is false, q is set to the result of the bitwise operation:
Not(
(q[511:1] and q[511:0] and {q[510:0], 1'b0}) or
(not(q[511:1]) and not(q[511:0]) and not({q[510:0], 1'b0})) or  
(q[511:1] and not(q[511:0]) and not({q[510:0], 1'b0})) )

The port connections of the instantiated modules are:
clk is connected to the clock input of q
load is connected to the load input of q
data is connected to the data input of q
q is connected to the output of q
