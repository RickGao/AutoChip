{'role': 'user', 'content': '//  This top Verilog module is used to control the behavior of a computer and a car. The module has four inputs and two outputs. The first input is a signal called "cpu_overheated" which is used to indicate whether the computer is overheating. The second input is a signal called "arrived" which is used to indicate whether the car has arrived at its destination. The third input is a signal called "gas_tank_empty" which is used to indicate whether the car\'s gas tank is empty. The fourth input is a signal called "shut_off_computer" which is used to shut off the computer. The two outputs are signals called "keep_driving" and "shut_off_computer".   The module contains two always blocks. The first always block is used to control the "shut_off_computer" output. If the "cpu_overheated" input is high, the "shut_off_computer" output will be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to 0. The second always block is used to control the "keep_driving" output. If the "arrived" input is low, the "keep_driving" output will be set to the inverse of the "gas_tank_empty" input, otherwise it will be set to 0.\n\nmodule top_module (\n\tinput cpu_overheated,\n\toutput reg shut_off_computer,\n\tinput arrived,\n\tinput gas_tank_empty,\n\toutput reg keep_driving\n);'}
