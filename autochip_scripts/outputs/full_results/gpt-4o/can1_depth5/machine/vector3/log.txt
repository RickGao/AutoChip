system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // The top module contains 6 ports that are fed into a concatenation which outputs 4 ports.
The first input "a" is fed into the first port in the concatenation, the second input "b" is fed into the second port of the concatenation, the third input "c" is fed into the third port of the concatenation, the fourth input "d" is fed into the fourth port of the concatenation, the fifth input "e" is fed into the fifth port of the concatenation, the sixth input "f" is fed into the sixth port of the concatenation. The last bit of the concatenation is 2'b11. This value is fed in to the last port of the concatenation.
