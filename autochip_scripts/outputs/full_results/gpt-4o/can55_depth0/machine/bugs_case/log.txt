system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // This top Verilog module is a keyboard module. It takes an 8-bit code as an input and outputs a 4-bit number and a valid bit. The 8-bit input, code, is a scancode generated by the keyboard. The 4-bit output, out, represents a 4-bit number represented by a key. The 1-bit output, valid, indicates whether a key is valid.  The 4-bit output, out, is assigned to 0. The 1-bit output, valid, is assigned to 1. Then, the module uses a case statement to assign the output based on the value of the 8-bit input, code. If the 8-bit input is 8'h45, 8'h16, 8'h1e, 8'h26, 8'h25, 8'h2e, 8'h36, 8'h3d, 8'h3e, or 8'h46, the 4-bit output will be set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively. If the 8-bit input does not match any of the cases, the 1-bit output, valid, will be set to 0.
