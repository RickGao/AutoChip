{'role': 'user', 'content': '// The top Verilog module is a branch predictor that predicts whether a branch instruction should be taken or not. It has an input clock (clk) and an asynchronous reset (areset) to control the module. It also has inputs for the prediction valid signal (predict_valid) and the prediction taken signal (predict_taken). The output of the module is the predict_history signal, which is a 32-bit vector that stores the history of the branch predictions.  The module also has inputs for the training signals, which are used to update the predict_history signal. The train_mispredicted signal indicates whether the previous prediction was mispredicted, while the train_taken signal indicates whether the branch was taken or not. The train_history signal is a 32-bit vector that stores the history of the actual branch instructions.  The module works by always checking the clock and reset signals. If the reset signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not asserted, the module checks the train_mispredicted and predict_valid signals. If the train_mispredicted signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is updated with the train_history and train_taken signals. If the predict_valid signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is updated with the predict_taken signal.\n\nmodule top_module\n(\n    input clk,\n    input areset,\n    input predict_valid,\n    input predict_taken,\n    output logic [31:0] predict_history,\n    \n    input train_mispredicted,\n    input train_taken,\n    input [31:0] train_history\n);'}
