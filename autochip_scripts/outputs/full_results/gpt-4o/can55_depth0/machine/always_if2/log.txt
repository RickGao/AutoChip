system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is used to control the behavior of a computer and a car. The module has four inputs and two outputs. The first input is a signal called "cpu_overheated" which is used to indicate whether the computer is overheating. The second input is a signal called "arrived" which is used to indicate whether the car has arrived at its destination. The third input is a signal called "gas_tank_empty" which is used to indicate whether the car's gas tank is empty. The fourth input is a signal called "shut_off_computer" which is used to shut off the computer. The two outputs are signals called "keep_driving" and "shut_off_computer".   The module contains two always blocks. The first always block is used to control the "shut_off_computer" output. If the "cpu_overheated" input is high, the "shut_off_computer" output will be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to 0. The second always block is used to control the "keep_driving" output. If the "arrived" input is low, the "keep_driving" output will be set to the inverse of the "gas_tank_empty" input, otherwise it will be set to 0.
