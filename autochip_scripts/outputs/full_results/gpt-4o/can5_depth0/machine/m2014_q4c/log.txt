system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a simple register that is used to store data. It has three inputs: a clock (clk), a data input (d), and a reset (r). It also has one output, q, which is the output of the register.   The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock. When the reset is active, the output of the register is set to 0. Otherwise, the output is set to the value of the data input. This allows the register to store the data input until the reset is activated.
