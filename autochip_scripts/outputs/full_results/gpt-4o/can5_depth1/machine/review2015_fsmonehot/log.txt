system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // 	The top module is a state machine. There are 10 states in this state machine, which are S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count and Wait.
	The done signal is 1 in the state Wait.
	The counting signal is 1 in the state Count.
	The shift_ena signal is 1 if any of the states B3, B2, B1 and B0 is active.
	The output of the top module B3_next is 1 when the state B2 is active.
	The output of the top module S_next is 1 when the state S and d is 0, or the state S1 and d is 0, or the state S110 and d is 0, or the state Wait and ack is 1.
	The output of the top module S1_next is 1 when the state S and d is 1.
	The output of the top module Count_next is 1 when the state B3 is active, or the state Count and done_counting is 0.
	The output of the top module Wait_next is 1 when the state Count and done_counting is 1, or the state Wait and ack is 0.
