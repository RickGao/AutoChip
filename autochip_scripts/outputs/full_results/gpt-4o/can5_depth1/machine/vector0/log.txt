system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This top Verilog module is a simple 3-bit vector to 3-bit scalar converter. It has 3 inputs, vec, which is a 3-bit vector, and 5 outputs, outv, o2, o1, and o0. The outv output is a 3-bit vector that is the same as the input vector, vec. The o2, o1, and o0 outputs are 3 scalar outputs, each representing one bit of the input vector. The o2 output is the most significant bit of the input vector, vec, the o1 output is the middle bit, and the o0 output is the least significant bit. The module assigns the outv output to be the same as the vec input, and assigns the o2, o1, and o0 outputs to be the same as the bits of the vec input.
