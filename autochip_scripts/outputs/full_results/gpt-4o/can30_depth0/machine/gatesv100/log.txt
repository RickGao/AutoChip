system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is used to compare two input signals and generate three output signals. The first input signal is a 100-bit wide vector, and the second input signal is the same vector shifted by one bit. The module has three output signals, out_both, out_any, and out_different.   The out_both signal is generated by performing a bit-wise AND operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 99-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 only if both the corresponding bits of the two input signals are 1.  The out_any signal is generated by performing a bit-wise OR operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 100-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the two input signals is 1.  The out_different signal is generated by performing a bit-wise XOR operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 100-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 only if the corresponding bits of the two input signals are different. The first bit of the out_different signal is generated by performing a bit-wise XOR operation between the first bit of the first input signal and the last bit of the second input signal.
