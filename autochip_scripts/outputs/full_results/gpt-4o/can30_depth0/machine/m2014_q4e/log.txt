system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: //  This Verilog module is a combinational logic module that takes two input signals, in1 and in2, and produces one output signal, out. The output signal is the logical negation of the logical OR of the two input signals. This means that the output signal will be high (1) if both input signals are low (0), and will be low (0) if either of the input signals is high (1). This module is useful for implementing logic functions such as a NAND gate or a NOR gate.

	input in1,
	input in2,
	output logic out

assistant: module top_module (
	input in1,
	input in2,
