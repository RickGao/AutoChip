{'role': 'user', 'content': '// We want to create a timer that:\n// (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,\n// (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n// (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n// (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n// In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.\n// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}
