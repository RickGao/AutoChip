After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\n\nmodule top_module(\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput reset,\n\tinput data,\n    output reg shift_ena,\n    output reg counting,\n    input done_counting,\n    output reg done,\n    input ack );'}

This Verilog code implements a finite state machine as specified in the problem description. The state machine goes through states to detect the "1101" pattern, enables shifting for 4 clock cycles to fetch the delay duration, waits for the counting to complete, and then notifies the user until acknowledged, finally resetting to detect the next pattern sequence.'}
