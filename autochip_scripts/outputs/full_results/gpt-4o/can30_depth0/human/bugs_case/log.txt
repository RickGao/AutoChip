system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // This combinational circuit is supposed to recognize 8-bit keyboard scancodes for keys 0 through 9. It should indicate whether one of the 10 cases were recognized (valid), and if so, which key was detected. If the 8-bit input is 8'h45, 8'h16, 8'h1e, 8'h26, 8'h25, 8'h2e, 8'h36, 8'h3d, 8'h3e, or 8'h46, the 4-bit output will be set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively, the 1-bit valid would be set to 1. If the input does not match any of the cases, both output signals would be set to 0.
